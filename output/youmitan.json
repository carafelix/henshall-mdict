According to Qiu, 强 (a variant of 強 ; standard in PRC usage) originally refers to type of ‘insect’ 虫 60, but came to be used as substitute for another graph of more complex shape, i.e. 彊 . In part, this was because pronunciation for the two words concerned in early Chinese represented by 強 / 强 and 彊 was identical, if we accept Schuessler’s reconstruction of sound values. Latter graph is made up of 弓 ’bow’ 107 and two ‘field’ graphs 田 63 with three straight dividing lines (note that as independent graph this component here had the sense of ‘boundary’). The meaning of 彊 , first found in OBI texts, is tentatively taken as ‘strong bow’ by Tōdō, who sees ‘unmoving’ – and thereby ‘strong’ – as extended senses of ‘boundary’. As for 弓 , it is thought that the bow, being of standard length, may have had the additional role of being a convenient tool for making land measurements.

Has 彡 ‘color, brush pattern’ (etc.) (determinative no. 59), and left-hand element identical with or close in shape to 井 1575 ‘well’. In one view, taken as consisting of 彡 meaning ‘writing brush hairs’, and 开 as phonetic with associated sense ‘imitate, model after’, giving ‘model, copy’ (Katō). Another analysis treats as 彡 ‘pattern’, and 开 / 井 as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘square frame’, giving ‘mold (to make copies)’ (Tōdō). Shirakawa also sees 开 / 井 as representing a frame or mold.

Ogawa identifies same two elements as ‘keep in the hand’. Instead of 止 , Tōdō takes top element as 之 (NJK; ‘move, go’, see 151). Note some OBI and bronze forms of 止 and 之 are very similar ( 之 might originally have depicted foot, like 止 ); Karlgren asserts 止 ‘is mostly used in the bone and the bronze inscriptions as loan for the homophonous 之 in its various meanings’ (Schuessler has these two graphs as near-homophones, not complete homophones in Late Han times). Originally meaning ‘control with hand’, in Han times 寺 acquired the sense of ‘place to control/administer’, and also – after transmission of Buddhism to China c.1 st century A.D. – the more specialized sense of ‘Buddhist temple’. By clerical script stage upper element had changed to 土 . MS1995:v1:392-3,18-19; KJ1970:480; OT1968:285; BK1957:253-4; AS2007:613; SK1984:230. Take as 土 64 ‘ground’ and 寸 920 ‘hand’.",

The top element 口 22 ‘round’ is semantic, and Tōdō takes it in this role only; Mizukami, Katō, and Yamada choose to take it as phonetic with associated meaning ‘round’, as well as semantic. ‘Member’ and ‘official’ appear to be modern meanings.

The graph elements show distortion in progression from seal to standard script, and Qiu notes that as part of the evolutionary process what was originally a separate graph in seal script for another word meaning ‘wooden handcuffs’ also ended up having the same shape in block script as 幸 .

Shirakawa explains 冬 as being the first way of writing ‘end’ (as well as ‘winter’), with 糸 added to it later when 冬 came to be used primarily for ‘winter’, thus distinguishing the two words in writing.

In ancient China, slaves were tattooed on the forehead with a needle to indicate ownership, and ‘eye’ here is taken to denote forehead, the eye being much easier to represent pictographically. There is debate over this graph’s diff erent meanings ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’. Qiu observes that in ancient texts 童 represented both ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’, and that by the time of Shuowen the NJK graph 僮 had been devised to create the orthographically contrastive pair 童 ‘slave, servant’ as opposed to 僮 ‘child’, but even after that 童 was still often used for ‘child’, and likewise 僮 has meanings of both ‘child’ and ‘servant’. In early Chinese, the associated words for ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’ appear to have been of the same pronunciation, assuming they were in fact separate words (Schuessler lists them together as one entry). Aesthetically a displeasing graph at bronze stage because it consists of multiple elements one on top of the other; this visual imbalance became moderated at the seal script stage.

As for the use of 様 for‘ –sama ’ as a polite suffix, there was an independent Japanese word sama ‘condition/appearance/shape’, found from about the tenth century, sometimes written as 様 , and its use in modern Japanese for ‘ –sama ’ as a suffix may be regarded as a loan usage.

Analyzed by Yamada as 夊 in line with the seal form (‘walk slowly, drag feet’ [determinative 35; see Appendix]), with (an obsolete graph meaning ‘favor, feel compassion’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘by stealth’, to give overall meaning ‘walk stealthily’; Katō sees this tentatively as the possible meaning also. Both scholars regard ‘love’ as a loan usage. Mizukami notes an alternative analysis: 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ with 夂 ‘descending foot’ (determinative 34) and 旡 (originally, pictograph of person who has eaten till full) ‘be full; stick in the throat’; overall meaning is ‘difficult to move forward with heart full of anguish’, and ‘love’ as loan usage. Note this analysis has 夂 ‘descending foot’, but treats as meaning 夊 ‘walk slowly’. Morohashi quotes the voluminous 17 th century dictionary Zhengzitong in treating as the original way of writing 愛 . He makes no mention of loan usage for ‘love’, though it would appear to be valid to take ‘love’ as an extension of ‘favor, feel compassion’, the original meaning of .

Traditional form has 鹵 , based on pictograph of salt or salty soil contained in a basket-like container, and 監 1159 (‘watch’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bitter’ (Katō, Yamada); Schuessler, though, considers the proposed associated sense ‘bitter’ as unlikely here, on linguistic grounds. Ogawa, by contrast, takes the sense of the phonetic as ‘soak in water’, namely seawater. This is noted tentatively as a possibility by Mizukami also, who gives a bronze equivalent that includes 氵 42 ‘water’ as an additional component, though the ‘water’ component here could alternatively reflect part of a process for obtaining salt (‘rock salt’) from salty soil. Salt was an important trading commodity in ancient China, as in other ancient civilisations, due in part to its preserving qualities. The modern (block script) form has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, reflecting that one salt production method was from the ground. The right-hand side is a simplified modification in shape to the upper right and lower elements of the traditional form (examples of the simplified right-hand side can be found in Han time clerical script).

Shirakawa also links 矦 to ‘target’, but regards it as referring to a purificatory ritual involving shooting arrows. Treatment by scholars reflects a degree of historical confusion between 候 and 侯 , two graphs similar in shape, pronunciation, and meaning. Uncertainty over the early history of the words and meanings represented by these two graphs is noted by Schuessler. As for the meaning ‘serve’ (primarily as an older meaning), Shirakawa observes on the basis of information in Yupian that in higher circles in early China there was a position designated as 候人 , a role which involved greeting visitors. The meanings ‘weather’ and ‘sign’ for 候 can be seen as extended senses deriving from ‘look out for’ relating to weather conditions. In ancient China the year was divided into the ‘seventy-two short periods’ ( 七十 二候 ), of five days each. Numerical categories such as this – other examples include the Five Elements ( 五行 ), the Eight [Musical] Sounds ( 八音 ), and the Ten Moral Obligations ( 十義 ) to name but a few – have been an integral part of Chinese culture from ancient times.

Has 刂 198 ‘knife/cut’, and (listed in Kangxi zidian as an old way of writing 豕 89 ‘wild boar, pig’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘scrape, shave off’, to give ‘scrape with knife’ (Katō, Yamada). Katō also links 刷 to 削 1385 ‘scrape, pare, cut’, while Schuessler considers it to be probably related to NJK 刮 ‘scrape’, which comprises 刂 198 ‘knife’, with 舌 755 (‘tongue’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘create space’, giving original meaning ‘scraping tool’. Tōdō and Ogawa, alternatively, take the associated sense as ‘rub’, which is the meaning of another graph of similar shape, i.e. , which has 又 2003 ‘hand’ as determinative and originally referred to wiping one’s bottom (Katō). It is generally considered that printing – on wooden blocks – was invented in China; the earliest surviving printed book dates from 868AD, though earlier shorter printed texts or images do exist. Rubbing was part of the process of printing texts on wooden blocks, but it was a lesser task: the more demanding main work involved the actual engraving, i.e. the cutting out of text and/or images on the blocks, in reverse; a sheet of paper was then applied to the surface of the inked block and rubbed to produce the text or image. The earliest printing technology dates from later than the emergence of seal script, so it would be wrong to connect the etymological origins of 刷 to considerations of printing. Nevertheless, use of the ‘knife’ determinative is supportive of interpretation of 刷 as ‘scrape’ rather than ‘rub, wipe’, as Katō points out.

As for 祭 299 ‘worship; festival’ (originally meat [and in some cases wine] being placed on an offering table/altar), Katō and Yamada treat this as a phonetic component with an associated sense ‘place on top’, to give the overall meaning ‘cover’. Yamada regards the meanings ‘look carefully, examine’ as loan usage. Katō too is of the same opinion. Shirakawa, for his part, takes 祭 as having a semantic role, with its original meaning, to give the proposed overall meaning of ‘make offerings in a shrine’ – presumably under a roof. Tōdō, by contrast, proposes the associated sense ‘cleanse and examine’, on the basis of classical usage. KJ1970:426; YK1976:205; SS1984:349; KJ1985:172.

To disambiguate 芺 in the two senses of ‘thistle’ and ‘laugh’, 口 was added for the latter meaning, to give . As a further complicating twist, 口 22 (‘mouth’) was also added to 关 / above, to give 咲 1391 (note: 咲 is used in the sense ‘bloom’ only in Japanese; in Chinese it retains its original sense ‘laugh’). In broad terms, Ogawa adopts a broadly similar view, taking 芺 as being the result of miscopying, and borrowed as a loan for a word meaning ‘act coquettishly’; Katō treats the sense ‘act coquettishly’ as the original meaning of 笑 , and ‘laugh’ as a further extension of meaning. In the above there is reference to 竹 as a top element having been substituted for 艹 53 (‘grass, plant’); the explanation for this is that in the clerical script (the developmental stage before block script) these two elements were sometimes used interchangeably (as top elements), as noted by Qiu.

    "etymology": "Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); treated by Mizukami as having OBI and bronze equivalents (see below). Consists of 目 76 ‘eye’, with a second element 少 160 (‘few’) which is taken either as phonetic in function or as semantic, depending on the scholar. The phonetic view (Katō, Yamada) takes 少 as having the associated sense ‘cover, conceal’, and links 省 to what in seal script is the similarly-shaped 眚 , which means ‘cannot see clearly’ (a CO; in modern Chinese usage has meanings ‘cataract’ and ‘disaster’). Katō and Yamada feel that confusion arose between 眚 and 省 due partly to the similarity of shape, but also because of similarity in pronunciation between 省 and 視 889 ‘see’, which led to ‘see’ being taken (misunderstood) as the main sense of 省 ( 省 is noted as ‘see’ in Shuowen ). Ogawa also considers that 少 came to be used sometimes in place of 生 44 (‘life’) in this graph through error arising from the similarity in shape of these elements (there is limited similarity in shape between the two in some bronze forms). Tōdō treats the 少 of 省 as having a semantic function, and includes the graph and underlying word in a word-family ‘divide up small’; on this basis, he takes 省 as ‘make the eyes narrow and look’; ‘examine’ may then be seen as an extended sense, along with ‘ministry’, for in ancient China one had to pass examinations to work for the government.. Both the semantic and the phonetic interpretations are listed by Mizukami. 眚 (but not 省 ) is regarded by various commentators as having OBI and bronze equivalents, though Mizukami lists and treats both these graphs as occurring at the OBI and bronze stages with the same or ‘shared’ shapes, with divergence first occurring at the seal stage. Yamada suggests this divergence in shape between the two arose due to an old or regional variant being adopted as the basis for 省. Whichever analysis is followed, the sense ‘omit’ may be regarded as a loan usage. KJ1970:598-9; YK1976:270-71; OT1968:697; MS1995:v2:916-18,920-21; TA1965:481-2.",

Katō treats top element as pictograph of container – in this case wine strainer or press – but here acting as phonetic (corresponding to later 甾 ) and having associated sense ‘gather, collect’, to give ‘birds gather and settle on a tree’. As things are collected in a container, the top element may be taken as both semantic and phonetic if Katō is followed. OT1968:508; SS1984:542; KJ1970:432.

In this view, overall meaning of 卒 is ‘dyed garment’ (Katō, Yamada), and senses such as ‘sudden’ and ‘die’ are loan usages. In contrast, Shirakawa attributes a ritualistic significance, considering ‘die’ to be the main meaning of this graph, based on it originally showing an upper garment for a dead person, with the element 丿 showing a cord for tying; a similar type of garment was later worn also by low-ranking servants and soldiers. In Shirakawa’s treatment, the sense ‘sudden’ appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:651-2; YK1976:338; OT1968:139; MS1995:v1:168-9; SS1984:556.

It was also used in early Chinese for a near-homophone meaning ‘to be different’, and thus ‘special’ may be regarded as a loan usage. The left-hand side of 別 , which is noticeably different in shape in block script from the seal form of 冎 , appears to result from cursivized equivalents found in the clerical script.

Scholarly opinion is divided over whether OBI forms for this graph exist, and whether there were originally separate graphs for 末 and the similarly-shaped 未 617 (qv, originally, ‘tree with luxuriant growth’). There is general agreement that the graph 末 shows branches growing out from a tree (though Tōdō takes it to signify small branches at the top of a tree and equivalent originally to 未 ), but while Mizukami and Ma do not recognize any OBI forms, Katō and Yamada list what they take to be OBI forms for 末 , and consider that originally, at least, there was no difference in shape between 末 and 未 . The upper horizontal stroke of 末 is taken to focus attention on the top part of the tree, signifying ‘tip, end’ in a physical sense and by extension the abstract sense also, i.e. ‘end; last, final’.

Originally, in OBI and some bronze forms, this graph had the same shape as what later became 舞 1920 (person with long decorative sleeves, shown with feet pointed away from each other; ‘dance’). Taken to depict a person dancing with what appear to be long decorative sleeves, or what Qiu identifies as oxtails or similar hanging down. While Qiu’s suggestion might seem bizarre initially, he does note a passage in the Spring and Autumn Annals (compiled ca. 239BC) which describes dancing while holding oxtails. This graph, which originally had the sense ‘dancing’, was borrowed to conveniently represent another word of similar pronunciation meaning ‘not have’. In some bronze forms (and consistently later), we find 舛 (feet pointing different ways 336) added to further clarify the sense ‘dance’, while a different element (corresponding to modern 亡 985, now meaning ‘die’ or disappear’ but originally showing someone hiding in a corner and meaning: ‘cannot be seen’) was added to the predecessor of 無 at the seal stage. Shapes close to 無 itself, which is somewhat simpler than the seal equivalent, were already well-established in the clerical script. QX2000:186-7; YK1976:466-7; OT1968:621; AS2007:518; SK1984:467-8.

It originally depicted wine or soup being ladled into a container such as a half-gourd, but here it acts as a phonetic with associated meaning ‘bind, fasten’, to give ‘fasten tightly with cord (in some cases leaving noticeable marks)’. By extension, it acquired meanings such as ‘reduce, contract, bring together’, and then abstract meanings such as ‘make agreement’ and ‘summarise’. (One notes the similar use of the figurative concept/term ‘binding’ in English with regard to agreements and promises.) The latter sense of ‘summarise’ involves removal of non-essential points or items, thereby perhaps generating the meaning ‘approximately’. Early (post-OBI) senses listed by Schuessler include ‘abbreviate, condense, essential’. OT1968:768; MS1995:v2:1004,v1:146-7; KJ1970:874; YK1976:475.",

This combines with the disputed upper element . Katō takes as the old form of 螢 (‘firefly’; modern 蛍 1263), here serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘surround’, to give ‘complex of buildings surrounded by fence/walls’. Yamada and Ogawa agree with this interpretation. Mizukami lists several alternative interpretations of what represents here, but still with the sense ‘surround’. ‘Barracks’ may be regarded as an extended sense. ‘Perform, conduct’ is treated as loan usage by Yamada; Schuessler notes ‘lay out, plan, build’ as early meanings.

Ogawa takes 嬰 as 女 with 賏 as both phonetic and semantic, giving ‘woman wearing necklace’, and by extension ‘surround’ (here ‘neck’), seeing ‘baby’ as loan usage. Both analyses have associated meaning ‘small’, significance being that in ancient China both peach and cherry were prized as fruits, and there are early references (noted by Katō) to cherry fruit being called ‘small peach’. Note: the graph 桜 and word sakura normally refer to flowering rather than fruiting cherry. KJ1970:83,3; MS1995:v1:346-7; OT1968:264,502; SS1984:65. Take top right as three petals.",

    "etymology": "Bronze ; seal ; traditional 假. Originally, this graph was written 叚 . Bronze form consists of i] two hands, with ii] an additional element 厂 (usually taken as ‘cliff’ or ‘cave dwelling’) with two short horizontal strokes or dots inside. There is some divergence in analysis. One element is often taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘false, deception; substitute’, to give the overall sense ‘wear a mask’ (Katō, Mizukami, Yamada, Ogawa). The basis for the inclusion of ‘mask’ here may not seem clear, but both Shirakawa and Tōdō also support this. Tōdō includes 叚 (and 假 ) in a word-family meaning ‘cover something underneath’, an interpretation which gives credible support for the sense ‘wear a mask’. Abstract meanings such as ‘imitation, provisional, temporary’ may be seen as extended senses. The element 亻 41 ‘person’ was added at the seal stage, with no significant change of meaning. The substitution of 反 for 叚 to create 仮 can be traced back to Han period cursivized clerical script forms.

Normally one would not associate shaving with the forehead, but in ancient China (and in various periods in Japanese history also), the hairline was shaved so as to move hair further up the forehead, and /or trimming it at the sides, leaving a ‘desirable/fashionable’ framing of the forehead. Alternatively there is an interpretation of the phonetic element as having an associated sense of ‘wide, broad’, to denote the broad part of the face, again giving the meaning ‘forehead’ (Ogawa). ‘Frame’ is an extended sense related to the borders of the hairline, and ‘plaque’ may represent a further extension, whereas ‘amount /sum’ appears to be a loan usage.

The original form in Shuowen is 榦 , where the meaning is given as wooden posts standing firmly in the ground at each end when building a fence; the graph comprises 木 73 ‘tree’, with the element 倝 (disputed sense as phonetic here) in the variant form , which shows 人 41 ‘person’, in one of its modified shapes as 人 . 倝 (or the variant), which is often taken as originally meaning ‘sun rising up’ (Mizukami, Katō, Yamada), is taken by Katō and Yamada as a phonetic with associated sense ‘base, stem’, to give ‘trunk/stem (rising up)’; Shirakawa, by contrast, interprets as a flagpole topped with a good luck symbol and banner (Ogawa also says ‘flagpole’), and follows the Shuowen view in regarding two such flagpoles being used for fence-building. Qiu considers that the element 倝 in its variant form was poorly recognized as a phonetic, a point which no doubt led to substitution of 干 (modern meaning ‘dry’: see 840) as phonetic instead, creating 幹 originally as a popular variant of 榦 . Either interpretation of 倝 still leads to the basic sense ‘rising high’, which together with 木 gives ‘tree/pole rising high’, and hence ‘trunk, main part’.

Ogawa has a different view, taking 艮 as having associated sense ‘division’, to mean ‘eye cavity’ – presumably ‘eye socket’. Despite divergence in analysis, all scholars take 眼 as coming to mean ‘eye’ as a general term, like 目 76, though the two graphs are differentiated in modern written Japanese (and Chinese).

In the other similar graph 礦 , which importantly provides the link to the modern form, 廣 (traditional form of 広 127 ‘wide, extensive’) was substituted – probably as a phonetic loan – for 黃 133 based on their near-homophony in early Chinese.

The Shuowen explanation says ‘bamboo’ ( 竹 58), but not all commentators are convinced by such precise identification (Ogawa, Shirakawa). No doubt because the hand is supporting a branch or bamboo stalk, Ogawa regards ‘support’ as an extended meaning, and does not follow Yamada’s view that ‘support’ is a loan usage. In modern usage, 支 is often used for ‘support’ in a figurative sense (cf. 枝 719 ‘branch’). KJ1970:460; YK1976:212; OT1968:434; SS1984:359.",

Gu also makes this link, though he also proposes the above OBI equivalent, interpreting it as two hands holding up a mat taken away when departing government office, presumably with words of thanks (the same OBI form is interpreted differently by Mizukami, who sees it as an early predecessor of 識 – see 725). Gu’s interpretation involving a mat would appear to be reinforced by the OBI forms which Mizukami lists for 席 549 ‘seat’ (originally, pictograms of a mat, and interpreted in that way by Mizukami himself).

At the seal script stage, however, the ‘hand’ determinative 扌 ( 手 ) 34 was added to the near-homophone meaning ‘give’ so as to aid clarity.

Use of this graph seems to have related to ‘raise up’ and also ‘receive’ in a physical sense in early Chinese, and it came to be used in Japanese from quite an early stage with the latter meaning to represent a verb which, to give it its modern form, is uketamawaru ‘receive (from a superior)’, often to denote a verbal reference such as orders, and also historically as a polite verbal suffix. This background of use for 承 probably goes some way towards accounting for its additional senses in modern Japanese such as ‘hear’ and ‘know’. KJ1970:547-8; OT1968:403,19; YK1976:269; AS2007:185.

The connection with coinage and money is that, dating from the first millennium BC in China, there have survived examples of metal currency (separate from shell currency) actually in the shape of small knives or spades, and featuring short inscriptions; Qiu suggests that before the beginning of the formal use of money, spades probably served as a kind of currency in trade relations. In Japan, a new monetary system was adopted officially in 1871. The main unit in this decimal system was the yen, so called because the yen coins were round ( 円 4 ‘round, yen’), unlike the earlier oblong coins. As a lesser monetary unit, the ‘sen’ was adopted (one-hundredth of a yen); sen coins are no longer legal as currency, but the sen is still used sometimes in financial transactions. KJ1970:626; YK1976:319; QX2000:258-9. We suggest for the first mnemonic taking 金 in its meaning of ‘gold’, and for the second,‘ money.",

The graph consists of / 糸 29 ‘thread’ (‘silk thread’), and (originally, tree blossoms or leaves hanging down); the function and meaning of the latter element – which has been modified through simplification in the block script version – is disputed. One view takes as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘white’, to give ‘white silk’ (Katō, Yamada, Mizukami), or ‘separate into two’ (Mizukami), to give ‘white silk threads hanging separately’. Tōdō, by contrast, considers ‘white threads/silk’ to be an extended sense, and the original meaning to be ‘the original state’. Normally, however, the words and meanings represented by individual graphs progress from the concrete to the abstract, not vice versa, so the first interpretation above is probably the one to follow. Yamada gives a useful view regarding the overall semantic progression for this graph, namely ‘white silk’ generalized to ‘white’, then to ‘plain’ and ‘raw material’; ‘element’ may be regarded as coming within the same semantic spectrum. Mizukami looks to identify a corresponding bronze form. KJ1970:640; YK1976:323; MS1995:v2:1008-9,v1:22; TA1965:368-71.

In the Yupian dictionary the meaning of 俵 is noted as ‘distribute’, though Katō notes 俵 was also sometimes used in Han time texts in the sense of 表 . In Japanese only, 俵 is used exclusively with a different meaning, i.e. ‘bag, sack (for rice, etc.)’. The word DOHYŌ ( 土俵 ) means ‘sumo wrestling ring’ as well as ‘bag filled with sand (or similar)’, but this just reflects the fact that traditionally the ring is formed with sandbags. The explanation for use of 俵 for ‘sack, bag’ in Japanese may be that 表 originally referred to an enveloping outer garment, and similarly a bag or sack is itself an enveloping cover.

Yamada considers the meaning ‘dry’ reflects use of 干 as a loan graph for the more complex 乾 1145 ‘dry’ (homophonous in early Chinese, as in modern Japanese).

In support of this view is the fact that in medieval Europe deformed persons were often employed as jesters. Ogawa prefers to analyze 非 as phonetic with associated sense ‘oppose, go against’, giving ‘persons who amuse others by doing unusual things’. Yamada looks to identify a bronze form for 俳 .

One analysis of 甫 (analysis i]) takes the OBI and bronze forms as signifying ‘use an ax’, which is the Shuowen interpretation (&lt; 父 originally ‘hand holding ax’; now ‘father’ 216), over 用 ‘use’ (a loan meaning; 235); this is one analysis listed by Mizukami, though none of the OBI forms he lists actually support this – rather, they support the alternative view ii] which Mizukami lists, i.e. taking the OBI and bronze forms as representing a shoot of vegetation ( 屮 ) in a field or seedbed. Another credible interpretation – iii] – is offered by Shirakawa, who takes the early forms of 甫 as showing a sapling with a framework supporting the lower part (interestingly, the OBI form Shirakawa lists supports the ‘use an ax’ interpretation). While there is divergence over the original meaning(s) of 甫 , there does appear to be some agreement over the function of this element in 補 , i.e. that 甫 here serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘add on, patch’. Later, the idea of ‘garment’ was lost from 補 , leading to generalised meanings such as ‘repair’, ‘add on’. MS1995:v2:870-71,v1:256-8; YK1976:450; KJ1970:857; OT1968:905; SS1984:777.

Shuowen defines 鬱 as ‘luxuriant tree growth’, and according to Shirakawa, this referred originally to a special variety of wine with herbs, packed into jars. The Shuowen gives separate treatment to 鬱 and the similarly-shaped form ii]. The two graphs appear to have represented two homophonous words in early Chinese, one meaning ‘dense (forest)’ ( 鬱 ), and the other ‘fragrant herb’ (Schuessler). Shirakawa considers form ii] may have originally referred to a fragrant herb used in scented wine, but that form ii] and 鬱 then came to be used interchangeably. This reflects the view of traditional scholarship ( Kangxi zidian ). Mizukami, who gives what he regards as bronze equivalents for 鬱 and form ii], lists both with substantially overlapping meanings (core meaning: trees and other vegetation growing together in very close proximity), and treats ‘fragrant herb’ as a loan use of form ii]. The above variations in form together with differences in treatment of the component parts make this a challenging graph to analyze.

Originally a picto-graph, 且 was borrowed at an early stage as a convenient way of writing several other words or grammatical elements with more abstract senses, including ‘moreover’, hence its meaning in Japanese today.

Katō does not favour the ‘plant’ interpretation, and instead takes 乙 as meaning ‘twisted, bent’ (though commentators disagree on what precisely 乙 originally represented, there is substantial support for a core meaning ‘curved’; see 1072), and 倝 / (‘sun shines high in the sky’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘strong, which Katō then takes as giving an overall sense ‘something bent straightens out’. Yet another analysis – probably the best – is provided by Tōdō, who takes 乙 as ‘twisting’, and as ‘sun rises up’ (the bronze and seal forms of 倝 / include the element 日 ‘sun’ 66), giving overall sense ‘air rises up in meandering fashion’ for 乾 . As for the meaning ‘dry’ for 乾 , Tōdō sees this as semantically related to his interpretation of the original meaning of that graph; both senses are included in his word-family ‘rise up’.

This graph has several alternative shapes, mostly involving variation on the left-hand side (e.g. 欵 ), with 欠 496 (initially, pictograph of person with mouth open wide; now meaning ‘lack’). In addition, Gu lists one form that he treats as the OBI predecessor, consisting of left-hand 柰 (NJK, originally‘firewood on altar’, now meaning ‘what?’), with right-hand 又 ‘hand’ 2003, signifying a ritualistic request to the gods to be granted good fortune. Based on the seal forms, several other commentators (Katō, Ogawa) also take the core meaning of this graph/graph group as involving some sort of wish (still a meaning in Chinese). Regarding variation in shape, it is worth observing that Shuowen notes 款 written with 柰 on the left-hand side as an alternative form: it may well be that an original 木 as top left-hand element in one form of this graph later became corrupted to 士 (Ogawa takes this view). Katō analyzes 款 on the basis of the seal form in Shuowen as 欠 in its early sense ‘(mouth) wide open’, with a left-hand element 祟 (NJK ‘curse’, meaning given in Shuowen as ‘calamity initiated by the gods’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pit, cavity, void’, giving ‘what a person longs for’. Through association with ‘cavity, void’, Katō then takes ‘engrave’ (as in the case of inscriptions traditionally on artefacts such as bronze bells and vessels) as an extended sense. Other meanings such as ‘friendship’ and ‘clause’ are perhaps best seen as loan usages. GY2008:1365,1163; KJ1970:305; OT1968:533; DJ2009:v2:704,v1:11; AS2007:338.

A divergent view is offered by Katō, who maintains that 義 serves here as phonetic only, originally with an associated sense ‘young male (ox)’, which for sacrificial purposes was of a single color, and ‘single color’ subsequently came to predominate as the new associated sense, giving the overall sense ‘young ox of a single color’; in this interpretation, ‘sacrifice’ is an extended sense.

In standard modern Japanese usage, the semantically transparent component 犬 19 ‘dog’ here has been retained, but note that in 臭 1452 ‘smell, odor’ when used as an independent graph, standard usage still favors the semantically opaque 大 56 ‘big’ as lower element due to earlier script simplification.

Ogawa, though, takes ‘ladle’ as orig. meaning, and Gu takes as ‘woman kneeling submissively’, while Katō considers 匕 in 傾 / 頃 as having only a phonetic role with associated sense ‘not straight’, and by extension ‘lame’, and that the Shuowen explanation should be seen as ‘head’ representing ‘body’, thus giving ‘bent body’, but this seems debatable. See also Appendix for 匕 contrasting with 匕 (‘change’). TA1965:504-9; GY2008:602,1074,11; MS1995:v1:154-5; OT1968:77,132; KJ1970:357,796; AS2007:432.

One interpretation takes the graph as 𥝌 ‘tree with tip bent over’, with NJK 耆 (‘grow old, senility’; in this analysis, the element 尤 (orig. ‘blame’) in 稽 is regarded as a miscopying of the element 耂 [an abbreviation of 老 ‘grow old’ 638]) as a phonetic likewise with an associated sense ‘tree with tip bent over’, giving ‘tree with tip bent over’ (Katō); ‘consider’ is presumably to be treated as a loan usage. There are several other analyses. One of these looks to analyze 稽 as 尤 , with CO as phonetic with associated sense ‘be caught/entangled’, giving ‘detain’ (Ogawa). In this analysis, ‘plan, consider’ is again presumably loan usage. Alternatively, a ritualistic meaning is attributed by Shirakawa to 稽 , based on an interpretation as 𥝌 ‘tree with tip bent over’, with 尤 taken as ‘dog sacrifice’ (Shirakawa takes OBI form of 尤 as depicting an [unspecified] type of animal, presumably dog 犬 19), and 旨 1401 ‘gist, tasty’ as the original writing for 詣 1267 ‘respectfully visit’; Shirakawa then takes the overall original meaning of 稽 as ‘dog sacrifice ritual’, with the deity who is revered believed to come down to the venue of the ritual, thereby giving ‘reach’ as an extended sense. Presumably, by this explanation, ‘bow low’ is an extended sense too, and possibly also related to the ritual, along with ‘consideration’. At some point the tree with the tip bending right (whereas the regular way for the grain plant determinative 禾 is sloping down further to left) acquired the regular slope to the left. KJ1970:356-7; OT1968:736; MS1995:v1:402-3; SS1984:239-40,832. We suggest taking 禾 87 as ‘grain plant’, 尤 as 犬 19 ‘dog’ with bent leg, 匕 as man sitting, and 日 as ‘sun’ 66.",

The explanation regarding substitution of 舌 for 𠯑 appears to be that confusion arose at the graphic level between the two at an early juncture (possibly pre-seal stage); variant forms for these two which are roughly similar in shape are considered to exist (Gu, Mizukami). Another commentator gives a different analysis, taking 憩 as 息 ‘rest, repose’, with 舌 as the phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, thus likewise giving ‘stop and rest’ as the overall meaning (Ogawa). Note: 𠯑 , which in one view serves here just as phonetic, itself comprises 口 22 ‘mouth’, with not 氏 522, but a different element (meaning knife for carving) as phonetic with associated sense ‘close, block’, hence ‘close the mouth’ (Mizukami).

The meaning ‘give’ is also probably an extended sense, deriving from the offering of items in funerary ritual (Schuessler). Ogawa notes ‘use’ as a Japanese-only usage, and this may be based on 遣 having been employed to represent the Japanese verb tsukawasu meaning ‘send, dispatch’, and then being borrowed for the separate but homophonous honorific form tsukawasu meaning ‘use’ (strictly speaking, the Old Japanese equivalents of these two verbs, but the principle involved still holds). Similarly, the meaning ‘do’ associated with 遣 may derive from the fact that the verb yaru in Old Japanese meant ‘send, dispatch’, but later there evolved yaru meaning ‘do’, as in the modern language. Note: is interpreted in one analysis as depicting hands putting a bow into a grave pit, as part of a funerary ritual (Gu), or alternatively as depicting accumulated possessions piled up (Tōdō) / clods of earth made round with the hands into a mound (Katō).

Shuowen has 阬 , consisting of 阜 ( 阝 ) 1907 ‘hill, terraced slopes’, with 亢 (‘neck / throat, high, high spirits’, see 505) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘high’, giving ‘high/big hill’. This is the opposite meaning to 坑 , and Katō looks to explain the discrepancy on the basis of use of 阬 as a substitute writing for another homophonous / near-homophonous CO graph 隍 ‘dry moat’, and by extension ‘pit, hole’; such substitutions were common in early texts. Katō’s implication is that once this substitution became common, 土 64 ‘earth, ground, soil’ replaced 阜 ( 阝 ) as the determinative, resulting in a graph whose components then appeared more logical as a way of writing the word for ‘pit, hole’. An alternative interpretation, based on an explanation of 阬 in the ancient Chinese encyclopaedic dictionary Erya , takes 阝 here in the uncommon sense ‘hollow’, thus giving ‘hollowed-out pit’ (Tōdō). According to this interpretation, 亢 is being taken as the original way of writing 坑 . KJ1970:161; TA1965:398-401; OT1968:213; AS2007:250.

Ogawa interprets 亻/人 as having been added to 敖 so as to denote mainly ‘enjoy oneself at will ’ (our italics). If, though, the interpretation of the original meaning of 敖 as ‘emerge vigorously to a height’ (Katō) is accepted, the addition of 亻/人 to create 傲 can be taken as ‘person emerges vigorously above others’, giving ‘act arrogantly’ as an extended sense. Shirakawa, alternatively, looks to interpret both 敖 and 傲 as having a ritualistic origin. Note: 敖 is taken in one view as consisting of 屮 ’shoot of vegetation’, plus 攷 (CO ‘hit and bend’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge vigorously to a height’, giving ‘sprouts of vegetation emerge’ (Katō). Shirakawa offers a quite different analysis, interpreting as representing the corpse of a long-haired old person being ritualistically beaten on a stand.

An alternative analysis of this graph takes as 刂 ‘knife, sword’, and 肖 as phonetic with associated sense ‘contain’, thus ‘container for knife/sword’, i.e. ‘sheath, scabbard’ (Katō); in this analysis, conversely, ‘shave/plane, pare’ is seen as the borrowed usage.

Note 1: 咨 consists of 口 ‘mouth; say’ 22, and 次 308 (‘next’) as phonetic with associated sense taken by Shirakawa as ‘open the mouth and lament’, though Shirakawa prefers to take the idiosyncratic view of treating 口 here not as ‘mouth’ but ‘prayer receptacle’, giving (in his view) ‘inquire of the deities’. Note 2: In modern Japanese usage, 諮 is used for hakaru in the sense ‘formally inquire’, as at a committee meeting. Note 3: In socio-cultural terms the Japanese use consultations and seek advice a lot more than do Westerners, not normally from lawyers (in fact, litigation is relatively rare) but from seniors, often a section head or manager at their workplace. Doing things in the prescribed way is important, and orthodoxy is greatly respected, and – perhaps on a somewhat defensive note – it also helps diffuse responsibility if things go wrong. We suggest taking 咨 as ‘next, follow’ 次 308 and 口 as ‘mouth’, or alternatively ‘opening’.",

The graph 璽 , consisting of the same phonetic 爾 as in 壐 , but complemented by 玉 15 ’jade, precious stone’, later came to be used (once more), this time to specifically denote ‘Imperial seal’ as opposed to lesser seals. The element 玉 reflects the widespread (but not exclusive) use of jade for Imperial seals; sometimes bronze was used instead. Note: 爾 is typically taken to be based on pictograph of a spinning device for winding thread onto, though Mizukami notes an alternative view which takes it as a seal with handle having cords attached.

At OBI and bronze stages, the ancestral form of 溼 lacked element 土 . Though 溼 and 濕 are treated as separate graphs in Shuowen , later they became confused, and the river name graph 濕 came to be used in the sense ‘wet’. The simplified 湿 is perhaps based on a cursive form of 濕 . Note: a historical variant once used for 濕 is 漯 , with upper element 日 mistakenly written as 田 63 ‘field’, and lower 絲 29 (threads) simplified to 糸 , though 漯 is in essence a separate graph originally denoting a river name (different from the one referred to by 濕 ). The variant need not concern us here, but it does show the complicated historical usage around 濕 / 湿 .

Qiu notes another possible origin of 歹 , stating ‘it first appeared [as independent graph] sometime between the Song and Yuan dynasties’, derived from shape of Tibetan letter read ta , based on close cultural contact between Song and Yuan dynasties. Note, however, that as a determinative in graphs such as 殊 the shape 歹 was already commonly used as variant of 歺 from clerical script onwards, such as in texts on wooden strips recovered from Juyan, a frontier town established ca.104BC in what is now part of Inner Mongolia.

In one analysis, the associated sense for 乃 here is taken as ‘extend, stretch out’, giving ‘rice (sic; see Note 2) which grows tall’, and – by extension – ‘outstanding’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘emerge’, giving ‘grain plant with ear of grain emerging’ (Katō; Gu is in agreement). Another commentator (Shirakawa) prefers to treat 秀 as originally a pictograph of a grain plant with an ear of grain hanging down, but the status of the graph he bases this judgment on is less certain. Schuessler gives the meaning of 秀 as ‘to flower and set ears’ (grain), which follows Karl-gren. Karlgren considers lower element ‘may originally have depicted the root of the plant (?).’ Note 1: 乃 (NJK, ‘whereupon; possessive particle’) is interpreted in various ways, but is typically taken as having an original meaning such as ‘bent’; this is seen in the interpretation as pictograph of ‘hunchback’ (Katō) or ‘bow’ (Ogawa), while ‘bend/curve, bend easily’ (like an ear and ear-lobe) is an extended sense noted in Mizukami. Note 2: 禾 is originally a pictograph of a grain plant, but not specifically rice (though occasionally misinterpreted as such). OT1968:729; KJ1970:513; GY2008:445; MS1995:v1:16-18; SS1984:406.

Seal form has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and 龍 (traditional form of 竜 2081 ‘dragon’), the latter serving here as an abbreviation of 龖 (‘flying dragons’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘pile up, pile up around’, giving ‘put covers over a corpse’, then generalized to ‘cover’; by extension this came to mean ‘conceal horses and men’, then by further extension to make a surprise attack, then generalized to simply ‘attack’. It is unclear as to how it came to acquire the meaning of ‘inherit’, though it may derive from funeral rites and associated conventions. Katō sees the main meaning as being the funeral clothing. He is quite specific in asserting that the graph indicates putting a kimono (or kimono-like clothing) on a corpse by folding the left side under the right side, presumably contrary to that of a live person wearing a kimono. In Chinese there is still a meaning for this graph of preparing for burial. He treats 龍 as a phonetic with an associated meaning of ‘wrong way’ or ‘back to front’, and treats ‘attack’, ‘pile up’, and ‘inherit’ as all being loan usages. Schuessler points to a link in early Chinese between a word for ‘habit, custom’, and one for for ‘additional robe, cover’ which could explain ‘pile up’ and ‘inherit’. OBI forms for the upper element 龍 ( 竜 ) vary considerably in shape; the greater part of the OBI form given above seems to represent a shape for ‘dragon’. Modern form of 襲 1459 retains the traditional form for 竜 2081 as top element. KJ1985:550; MS1995:v2:1172-3; QX2000:234; TA1965:798-9; OT1968:910; AS2007:524.",

In one view, has 𠫓 ‘newborn infant’ (originally, pictograph of baby being born [head first and thus upside-down]; see Note 1 below), with 儿 (‘person’; a separate graph from ‘person’ 人 : see 41 and Note 2 below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘grow’, giving ‘child grows into adult’; by extension, ‘be mature/full’ (Katō). Alternatively, 儿 is taken not as phonetic but semantic in function, meaning ‘person’, combining with 𠫓 as an abbreviation of 育 247 ‘raise, educate’ to give the same overall meaning, i.e. ‘child grows to adult’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Note 1: 𠫓 is a stylized version of the seal form, which is interpreted as infant emerging from the mother’s body (the latter represented by a curved stroke like ). Kangxi zidian lists (4 strokes) as being in error for 𠫓 (3 strokes). In early 20th century Japanese book-printed font, still written as 3 strokes (e.g. in Ueda Bannen’s Daijiten [1917]), but in modern font modified to look as if begins with 亠 ; the traditional look-up determinative for 充 is 儿 (i.e. determinative 10 [cf. 人 / 亻 9]). Note 2: Interpretations vary. Mizukami interprets the seal form of 儿 as depicting the middle part of a mother’s pregnant body in side profile with swollen abdomen. Ogawa treats as ‘person’ or ‘person kneeling’. The OBI and bronze shapes (as non-independent element) for 儿 given by Gu, very close to those for 人 , became more distinctive in seal and clerical script; Gu takes as ‘person’. ‘Fill’, ‘provide’ would seem to be extended meanings.

In similar vein, Ogawa interprets the seal form as depicting a tree (and hence wood), plus branches bending with fruit or cimilar, giving ‘flexible’ and by extension ‘soft’.

The Shuowen seal form, which lacks the ‘water’ determinative ( 氵 ), has 止 143 ‘stop, (foot, footprint’, sometimes indicates motion as well as stopping) written four times, the top two being written upside down to convey the meaning ‘not move smoothly’; subsequently, 氵 42 ‘water’ was added as determinative to clearly indicate the meaning ‘water moves slowly/stagnates’. Then in block script, the element 止 written twice upside down in this graph was slightly modified in shape, but enough to obscure – presumably inadvertently – the fact it was originally 止 . By the time of Jiyun , a Chinese rhyme dictionary published in 1037, the entry for 澀 has 澁 noted as an alternative form. The lower right-hand element (four strokes) in the modern Japanese form 渋 is a device which was used occasionally for convenience in less formal pre-modern texts to represent reduplication of an element; another example in the modern script is 摂 1596 (‘take, act as proxy’), which is a simplified version of traditional 攝 . ‘Hesitate’ is an extended sense of 渋 ; ‘astringent’ is a loan usage.

Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 孰 (distortion in shape of the seal form, orig. ‘cook’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘make level/even’, interpreted as ‘building with rooms having earthen walls either side of entrance gate’ (Tōdō), or – in similar vein – ‘buildings either side of entrance gate’ (Ogawa). The main building would have been for a person of high status (Gu says ‘palace’). Such rooms or buildings were used for education, and so by extension ‘private academy’, or in modern usage ‘cram school’. As an indicator of socio-cultural values regarding education, the majority of students – particularly junior high students – spend virtually as many hours in juku than they do at school. Most of them attend juku on a Saturday, and several nights a week. And there is often no consideration for political correctness: while Western schools typically try to keep students’ grades private, many juku not only ignore this, after a test they put on the blackboard not only the top few performers, but also the the worst few performers. Note: 孰 ‘cook’ was later borrowed as a convenient way of writing a homophone/near-homophone meaning ‘who?’. For further details, see 熟 905 ‘ripe, mature’. TA1965:179-84; OT1968:223,269; GY2008:1745; AS2007:471,457. We suggest taking the elements as lid/cover 亠 , 口 22 ‘hole’, 子 27 ‘child’, 土 64 ‘ground’, and 丸 101 ‘round’.",

Other senses in Japanese such as ‘eat, drink; wear’ seem to be loan uses, taking sound value of mesu ‘call, summon’ equivalent to its meaning in Chinese when first borrowed and applying it to a homophonous verb meaning ‘eat, drink; wear’.

    "etymology": "A late, post- Shuowen graph. Originally used to mean a mineral encrustation often called ‘saltpeter’, i.e. potassium nitrate, employed in traditional Chinese medicine for digestion and as a laxative. Reflecting this, the corresponding word in Chinese was at first written using the different graph (but same phonetic) 消 332 (‘extinguish’). Later, the new graph 硝 was devised, replacing 氵 42 ‘water’ with 石 47 ‘rock’. The graph comprises 石 ‘rock, stone’, and 肖 1490 (‘resemble’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘absorb, digest’, giving ‘rock mineral to aid digestion’, and by extension – based on the later use of saltpeter (Song Dynasty onwards) – ‘gunpowder’ (Katō). Ogawa, alternatively, takes the associated sense of 肖 here as ‘pointed, sharp’, giving ‘type of mineral with crystals’, reflecting the naturally-occurrent state of saltpeter. On a historical note, China is credited with the first use of gunpowder. Moreover, by the 10th century it had the most sophisticated weaponry in the world, including explosive rockets, land mines, and flame-throwers. Despite this, they were beaten by the Mongols in the 13th century. When the Mongols went on to attempt to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281 – thwarted on both occasions by typhoons (kamikaze, ‘divine wind’) – they took gunpowder-based weaponry, such as cannon and grenades. It is a profound mystery in Japanese history as to why the Japanese did not try to develop their own gunpowder-based weaponry, for they could easily have retrieved cannons from sunken Mongol ships (or, earlier, simply by visiting China). Instead, they waited until the arrival of Portuguese in 1543, with cumbersome arquebuses, which were promptly improved by the Japanese. KJ1970:608-9; OT1968:712; SS1984:445; GY2008:1397-8.",

The Shuowen seal form of this graph does have the lower element written with what could be interpreted as representing a hump on the back. However, others consider it better to take the lower element as just 人 ‘person’. Accordingly, Gu takes it as ‘person at leisure at home’, and Ogawa is in agreement, saying ‘person at home without agricultural work’; all the above scholars following the definition of the graph in Shuowen to some degree. The original form with 宀 appears to have been replaced by semantically close 冖 ’cover’ after Han times; fluctuation in the lower element continued until 几 (in this graph a shape distortion, probably inadvertent) predominated, giving the shape 冗 familiar in modern Japanese usage. Regarding other meanings such as ‘waste, excess’, Katō regards these as extended senses based on a person being without work and hence unfocused, but Ogawa regards as loan usage.

Katō also takes ‘high, lofty’ as one possible associated sense, but notes ‘take charge’ as another, again leading to the meaning ‘mother’ (probably on the basis of one who is in charge of a household) and then too for ‘girl, young lady’. The Shuowen itself explains 孃 as meaning ‘confusion’, or alternatively ‘fat, corpulent’, and on the basis of the latter sense Shirakawa takes 孃 to refer to corpulent females, both mothers and daughters. Katō, however, considers this interpretation to be flawed. In the Tang Dynasty, both 嬢 and 娘 appear to have had a polite connotation (‘lady’ [Schuessler]).

The significance of the top horizontal stroke in OBI and seal (changed to near-vertical or vertical in block script) is not clear. This graph is widely considered to represent a needle for tattooing the foreheads of slaves and criminals as a mark of ownership. Tattooing was also one of the ancient Five Punishments, the others being cutting off the nose, cutting off a foot, castration, and capital punishment (ancient Chinese culture exhibits a fondness for numerical categories). The original meaning ‘tattooing needle’ (for slaves and criminals) gave rise to various extended senses such as ‘crime’, ‘painful’, ‘bitter, pungent’. The additional meaning ‘eighth of the ten Heavenly Stems’ (used in the traditional Chinese year-counting system) is a loan use. MS1995:v2:1274-5; KJ1970:942-3; OT1968:989; AS2007:538.

Gu, who takes 𦘔 to be the original way of writing 津 , considers on the basis of the OBI equivalent that 𦘔 originally depicted a person crossing a river or stream using a pole, and hence ‘river crossing place’. Ogawa, alternatively, analyzes as 水 ‘water, river’, plus 聿 as phonetic with associated sense ‘advance’, giving ‘cross river and advance, river crossing’, and the means to do so, i.e. ‘ferry’.

Separate from 脣 , there was another graph 唇 , having 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’ as determinative as opposed to 肉 . Originally, 唇 meant ‘be startled’, but this graph was borrowed from the Later Han period with a second meaning, viz. ‘lips’, and the two graphs were used interchangeably until the Song and Yuan dynasties (Gu). The later Kangxi zidian prescribed only 脣 as correct usage for the meaning ‘lips’, treating 唇 as erroneous in this sense. The form 唇 was officially approved in Japan when included in the Jōyō List promulgated in 1981. GY2008:1016; OT1968:823; DJ2009:v1:117; ZY2009:v2:345; SK1996:1356.",

Shirakawa, by contrast, takes the associated sense as ‘bundle/put together’, thus giving ‘sash to bring garments together’. It appears that 紳 was used to denote more elaborate sashes of a type worn by males of noble status, thus giving rise to the extended sense ‘gentleman’. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. In Chinese, in addition to ‘gentleman’, this graph retains meanings of ‘bind’ and ‘waistband’, whereas ‘sash, belt’ is effectively redundant in Japanese. SS1984:474; MS1995:v2:1010-12; TA1965:756.

Ogawa takes the meaning as ‘separate and clarify matters covered over’. Gu interprets the graph (both 宷 and 審 ) as meaning ‘inquire into/examine closely inside a room’. The same Shuowen entry also notes the form with 番 215 (‘number; guard’) substituted for 釆 , i.e. 審 .

This analysis therefore appears to already provide the meaning ‘hem, cuff’, though Tōdō takes this as a later, restricted meaning. In support of taking ‘hem, cuff’ as a later sense, on the other hand, is the Shuowen entry for 裾 , which defines it as ‘front part of a garment’. In line with this, the treatment by Gu also favors taking ‘front part of a garment’ as the original meaning, and several other meanings such as ‘back of a garment’ as extended senses. In Chinese only it can have a meaning of ‘robe’, which presumably could also be worn by males, whereas in Japan it is very much associated with females. Nor does the Chinese appear to encompass the extended concept of the ‘hem’ of a mountain. DJ2009:v2:677; TA1965:385; GY2008:1668.

Originally written as just 正 43 (‘correct, proper’), the OBI form of which has a foot pointed upwards towards an element shaped like 口 22 (‘mouth; entrance; hole’,) which Qiu takes as representing a destination. Since there were two words in early Chinese (Late Han) meaning ‘correct’ and ‘march against’ respectively and these were homophones, to clearly distinguish the latter in writing the element 彳 131’go/walk along a road’ (abbreviated form of 行 [originally, ‘crossroads’]) was added, resulting in 征 . Note: 彳 together with an upward-facing foot combine to give 辵 ‘walk step-by-step along a road’ (full way of writing 辶 / 辶 85). As both 彳 and 辶 / 辶 have much the same meaning, early graphs sometimes fluctuate between the two. For this reason, in pre-modern texts variants such as, for instance, 征 written with 辶 / 辶 as determinative instead of 彳 are sometimes encountered.

This combines with (see Note below), which is taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘rob, plunder’, to give ‘plunder rice stored in cave’. Gu, alternatively, takes it as semantic and phonetic, interpreting the overall meaning as ‘bore into cave/hole and steal’. A further variation is offered by Qiu, who is supportive of taking as ‘rat makes a hole to bite things and steal rice’. By extension, ‘plunder; furtively’. The cumbersome traditional form 竊 (22 strokes) was already dropped in favor of the much simpler 窃 , in the first Jōyō Kanji List promulgated in 1923. Note: the meaning of is interpreted differently as ‘mythical creature with large head and tail’ (Mizukami), or ‘(type of) insect’ (Gu, Shirakawa), while the view referred to by Qiu appears to take as ‘rat’.

In another analysis, the element combining with 干 is not 臼 ‘mortar’ but 臼 ‘two hands’, though in similar vein the meaning is ‘pierce, pound’ (Ogawa); these two shapes quite resemble each other in shape in seal, but more so in block script, hence the potential for divergence in interpretation as well as confusion in writing.

The change is difficult to date, but it is clear that 掃 was already being used in Han times. Katō prefers to take 帚 in 掃 as serving not a semantic but phonetic role with associated sense ‘make good, put in order’, giving ‘adorn and clean by hand’. The first view noted here seems more persuasive. DJ2009:v3:1120; QX2000:202; OT1968:420; GY2008:1182; FC1974:v1:940-41.",

Another view treats the same three elements as having a different overall meaning, viz. ‘make waterway bigger and improve flow’, and takes ‘tranquil, calm’ as an extended sense (Ogawa). Yet another meaning put forward for these three elements is ‘help out/rescue someone who has fallen into water’ (Shirakawa). Alternatively, the element 大 here is regarded as phonetic in function with associated sense ’emerge, escape’, giving ‘let (something) slip through the fingers in water’ (e.g. rice, when washing it) or ‘put through sieve’ (Katō). Sometimes borrowed on the basis of its sound value – more commonly in older texts – to write TAI ‘Thailand’. Correct interpretation of this graph is elusive.

The seal element/graph concerned, corresponding to the lower part of , namely , ‘is of uncertain meaning. Greater clarity, albeit provisional, is found in one of these (let us call it ‘form B’) in Shuowen which has 曰 1048 ‘speak’ instead of 白 ; form B is taken in one view as consisting of 曰 ‘speak’, and 竝 as phonetic with associated meaning ‘stop, desist’, giving ‘say “stop/desist” ’, and by extension ‘change’ (Ogawa). The third seal form (‘form C’) in Shuowen has 曰 beneath 兟 (CO, ‘advance’); this may just have evolved as a popular variant, as is suggested in the 17 th century Zhengzitong . Unsurprisingly, the majority of commentators omit treatment of this challenging graph. MS1995:v2:896-7,980-82; DJ2009:v3:841,v2:696; OT1968:479; ZZ1671:v1:551-2.

Alternatively, Ogawa takes the associated sense as ‘fill’, likewise giving ‘gall-bladder’. Shuowen defines 膽 as ‘organ which joins the liver’. 胆 is in origin a different graph from 膽 , listed in the Guangyun dictionary (early 11 th century) as originally having another meaning (possibly ‘saliva’), but 胆 was subsequently borrowed to write 膽 . Traditionally the gall-bladder was perceived to be the seat of courage, hence the extended use in that sense. Today, 胆 can be used in a general, non-technical way for either ‘gall-bladder’ or ‘liver’ (see Note following). Note: in modern Japanese, the medical term for gall-bladder is 胆嚢 TANNŌ ( 嚢 is ‘bag’ [NJK]) and that for liver is 肝臓 KANZŌ (see 肝 1142), but in popular everyday usage the native Japanese word kimo can refer to either, probably reflecting the close relationship between the two. Similarly, attempts are made to distinguish the use of 胆 and 肝 to write kimo meaning ‘liver/gall-bladder’ on the one hand and ‘courage’ on the other, but actual usage may not adhere to this.

Unfortunately, beyond saying that 痴 is a post-seal form it is difficult to give an indication of the period when it evolved. OT1968:680; KJ1970:691-2; DJ2009:v2:613.",

Other proposals for the unabbreviated phonetic are 時 151 (‘time’, Gu) and 丑 1454 (‘ox’, Shirakawa; see Note below). Despite some variation regarding the phonetic, commentators agree on the overall meaning ‘strong alcohol’; Schuessler says ‘spirits with sediment’. In Japan, it refers to lower-grade distilled alcohol with high alcohol content, made from sweet potato or rice wine lees. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. Note: 丑 was originally (OBI) a pictograph of a hand with fingers bent, about to grab hold of something, hence ‘grab with the hand’. It was subsequently borrowed to signify ‘Ox’ as the second of the Twelve Branches, used in traditional Chinese culture for such things as marking year dates on a recurrent cycle of sixty years. Shirakawa’s proposal is based on similarity in shape at the seal stage between 丑 and 寸 . MS1995:v2:1346-7,v1:6-7; OT1968:1026; GY2008:1014-15; AS2007:345.",

Another different analysis of 沾 takes 占 as having the associated sense ‘stay at one spot/place’, giving ‘cause/drop a stain’ (Tōdō) At a later stage (post- Shuowen ), 沾 sometimes came to be written instead as 添 (see Note below) in popular usage, and the latter form subsequently became predominant for the sense ‘add’. Katō regards ‘add’ as an extended sense from ‘overflow, full of water’. Note: in relation to 沾 , 添 replaces the phonetic element 占 here with 忝 (CO; ‘feel shame’) as phonetic, both have the same sound value in early Chinese.

According to Shirakawa, this ritual was performed to bring repose to the soul of such a person; in the latter view, ‘fill up, block’ is a generalized sense. Note modern simplified form 填 .

One view treats as 殳 ‘strike’ 170 (see Note below), with left hand part of (explained below) taken as phonetic, serving as onomatopoeic for the sound of hitting something, to give ‘hit something and make noise’ (Katō, Ogawa). This view is based on traditional explanation in Shuowen . Tōdō takes a different view, following instead information from the Han Dynasty character textbook Jijiupian , which explains as ‘hit buttocks of criminal with bamboo whip’. In this view, left hand part of represents a pair of buttocks seated on a stand or similar This seems a reasonable assessment of the seal form, and one which results in the more specific overall meaning for . Later came to be used to represent other words which were homophones or near-homo-phones such as ‘rear (of army)’ (noted by Schuessler) and ‘heavy foundations’. Based on the latter sense, came to be used by further extension for big buildings with heavy foundations such as palaces (Tōdō says this meaning evolved from the Qin Dynasty onwards). In texts in the clerical script, examples can be found of written in what was then a variant form, i.e. 殿 ; over time, this came to be the norm for this graph.

    "etymology": "Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). This graph appears to have been devised in the course of the monumental task of translating the Buddhist canon from Sanskrit into Chinese. As part of this process, many Sanskrit Buddhist terms were carried across into Chinese as loanwords by adapting them to the sound system of Chinese, very often also with abbreviation of the original Sanskrit. In this case, Sanskrit stūpa (‘Buddhist shrine’) was reduced to just one syllable and represented by 塔 , consisting of 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, with 荅 (CO, original meaning ‘red beans’) as phonetic to represent the Chinese approximation of the Sanskrit syllable tū in stūpa . Note: according to Katō, these Buddhist shrines were originally built using stone, tiles, and earth, which would help explain use of 土 as the determinative in 塔 , but he suggests there was also a semantic link between 塔 and 堂 584 ‘hall, temple’ on the one hand and 墳 1930 ‘mound, burial mound’ on the other. As is often the case, once loanwords have been adopted into a language, their meaning can change; in this case, changing to encompass a different shape such as a pagoda, and the use of wood as one of the construction materials. KJ1970:666-7; SS1984:647,645; OT1968:221. We suggest taking 荅 as 艹 53 ‘plant’, and 合 134 ‘join, put together’, along with 土 ‘earth’ 64.",

One treats as 攴 ‘hit with whip/stick’ 112, with a second element similar in shape to 井 1575 (‘well’, taken as ‘frame to enclose soil’, thus ‘flatten earth and make firm’ (Ogawa). In this view, senses such as ‘move’ are seen as loan uses. Another view (Katō) accepts variation in shape in OBI and bronze forms, but still feels that appropriate interpretation is 舟 1450 ‘boat’, combined with 殳 170, a determinative usually meaning ‘strike with weapon’. Originally, 殳 depicts hand holding a weapon (possibly halberd), but is taken here by Katō as pole used to propel boat, giving overall meaning ‘move boat round, go round by boat’; ‘move, transport, carry’ may be taken as extended senses in this analysis. Another view has the element later rendered as 舟 as meaning 盤 1877 ‘bowl’, and together with 殳 in sense ‘hit with stick’ is taken as ‘make a bowl’ (Gu; Shirakawa also notes as possible interpretation).

However, the heads were supposed to be cut off a living adversary, but many warriors took the easy way and decapitated corpses.

Later, such stones were used to help lower coffins on ropes down into the ground (Shirakawa notes this was facilitated by holes bored in the stones), and from that practice there also developed the custom (Han onwards) of recording details of the deceased onto the stones.

Note: Katō sees 卩 as a distortion of the seal shape (see right side of seal form above). He also sees 卩 as the original graph for ‘knee’, and 厀 to be – unusually – a form with 桼 added later as phonetic. Ogawa regards not 桼 but the similarly-shaped NJK 黍 (‘millet’) as the phonetic (same associated sense), though in the seal shape of 厀 it seems more like 桼 .

The OBI form of 豸 1363 is considered to depict a carnivorous wild beast about to pounce on its prey (Mizukami, Ogawa). The compound graph 貓 consists of 豸 combined with 苗 1897 (‘seedling’). Ogawa takes 苗 here as phonetic, serving as onomatopoeic for the miaowing sound made by a cat; Late Han period pronunciation of 貓 was mau (Schuessler). The form with 犭 (variant of 犬 19 in compound graphs, meaning dog or other creature/beast perceived as approximating to a dog in some way) in place of 豸 appears to be of late origin; this probably evolved as a popular form, but eventually was adopted as standard in the modern period.

Shuowen has 臚 as the entry heading, and notes 膚 as variant. 臚 consists of 月 / 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat, body’, with 盧 (CO, interpretations of meaning vary; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘spread, cover’, giving ‘flesh/that which covers surface of the body’, i.e. ‘skin’. At the clerical script stage, a significant change in shape took place, with left-hand 月 / 肉 commonly omitted and the lower element changed to 胃 447 ‘stomach’ (possibly as just a graphic variant). Note: occurrent OBI and bronze shapes of 盧 vary, and interpretations vary in consequence. Mizukami and Katō are agreed, though, that 盧 and 𧆨 are in essence one and the same graph, 皿 300 (‘bowl’) being an addition in some bronze occurrences. Lower element originally had not 田 63 ‘field’, but an element of roughly similar shape taken to represent a wine container; the upper element in some occurrences is 虍 (originally, pictograph of tiger’s head – an abbreviation of the fuller form 虎 1301 ‘tiger’) serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend, round, concave’. In other occurrences the upper element is seen as an inverted container, and so straining wine is taken to be one part of the meaning. The overall meaning is accordingly taken by Mizukami and Katō to be ‘round wine container made of willow for strained wine’. Gu, alternatively, interprets the graph as meaning ‘stove’.

A different analysis takes 方 as phonetic with associated sense ‘plot of land’ and 土 , giving ‘plot of land’ (Shirakawa); ‘town’ is an extended large-scale sense. Shirakawa notes that 坊 was used to denote plots of land – typically square – in a city divided up in terms of a traditional grid system. In turn, 坊 came to be applied in a Buddhist context for the divisions of space in a temple (including rooms), and the chief priest was known as 坊 主 BŌZU , a term which later came to be used as a general word meaning ‘(Buddhist) priest’; ‘boy’ seems to be a generalized sense deriving from ‘young boy priest’. ‘Town’ is now quite rare as a meaning.

The top element in 𠬸 is an old form of 回 92 ‘go round’, with 又 2003 ‘hand’ beneath. This is interpreted in one view as ‘put hand into water and take something out’ (Gu, Ogawa [Ogawa takes to be water swirling round]); alternatively, taken as ‘try to pull out person drowning’ (Shirakawa). is a later (block script) variant of 𠬸 , and quite close in shape to 殳 as in the modern form 没 (see Note below). At the seal stage, 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’ was then added as a determinative, resulting in 沒 . Several commentators prefer to analyse 沒 differently, taking it as consisting of 氵 ‘water’ combined with as phonetic with associated sense ‘sink, disappear’, giving ‘sink down into whirlpool’ (Katō, Mizukami). The connotation ‘go round, whirlpool’ is supported by the seal form. If the interpretation ‘sink down into whirlpool’ is followed, ‘sink, die, not exist’ may be regarded as extended senses. Note: The right-hand element in the modern form is 殳 , normally a determinative meaning ‘strike (with weapon)’ (170), but in 没 this is instead a later, potentially confusing regularization in shape of with meaning as explained above.

Shuowen defines 秏 as ‘type of rice’, which is how the graph and underlying word may have been used around the time of compilation of Shuowen , but 禾 is originally a pictograph of a grain plant with the head leaning down, and is generally understood as ‘grain’ as a general term encompassing millet, wheat, and rice, not just rice alone; as above, Katō takes in the general sense. Another commentator treats 毛 here as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘small’, and considers it to denote ‘small grains of rice’ (sic; Ogawa). As for the change in shape to 耗 , with the determinative changed from 禾 ‘grain’ to 耒 ’plow’ (CO, 699), this appears to have been a change made at some point in block script. Kangxi zidian has entries for both 秏 and 耗 ; in the entry for the former, it is noted that ‘texts nowadays all use 耗 ’.

Another interpretation, though, takes the right-hand element in one of the bronze occurrences as a shape representing not ‘ice’ but ‘fire’. This commentator (Gu) still recognises 冫 ‘ice’ as the determinative in the seal form, explaining this as being by analogy (melting of ice and smelting metal both resulting in liquid states). Note: On the basis of sound values and older forms (bronze and seal) the phonetic element 台 in 冶 is to be taken not as 台 183 ‘stand, platform’ (traditional form: 臺 ), but a different graph of the same shape meaning ‘(say) I, me’. The latter consists of 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, with 厶 (interpretations vary, but include ‘make one’s own’, or ‘plow’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘I, me’.

Mizukami notes an alternative view which takes the second element as ‘blade for scraping/gouging out’, but giving the same overall meaning. Shirakawa, alternatively again, takes 舟 as ‘bowl’ (presumably a meaning extended from ‘hollow out log as boat’ [based on a classical Chinese source, but Tōdō does not agree]) and the main part of the second element as a large surgical needle for removing blood and pus, with the accompanying single stroke as ‘showing blood and pus being transferred into the bowl’.

Shuowen has 女 37 ‘woman’, with 芺 (CO, a bitter-tasting type of plant) as phonetic; the graph is defined in that work as ‘skilful, or “woman smiling/laughing” ’. Later form 妖 has 女 combined with 夭 ‘young, beautiful’ (see Note below) taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘seductive, enticing (female)’ (Ogawa). Later, also used in negative senses such as ‘ominous, unlucky’, possibly as a result of interchange or contamination between 妖 and 夭 (see Note below). Note: 夭 is interpreted in one analysis as representing a figure with tilted head acting flirtatiously (Mizukami; Katō is in broad agreement). Ogawa also takes it to show a tilted head, but as an infant with supple body, giving ‘young’. 夭 was used in early Chinese texts not just for the words with the positive meanings just noted, but also for words which were near-homophone(s) with negative meanings. 女 was added later to minimize ambiguity in writing between the two. The semantic progression for the group of words with negative associations is considered to be as follows: ‘bend’ &gt; ‘break, cut off’ &gt; ’kill prematurely’(later, 殀 ) (Schuessler).

Originally (OBI, bronze) consists of 丮 (CO; depiction of a kneeling figure doing something with the hands: see also 1424), combined with 昜 161 (originally ‘sun rises’, modern meanings ‘change, easy’, see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise/lift up’, giving ‘lift up with the hands’. At the seal stage, 丮 was changed to 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’ Note: the original top element in bronze stage equivalents of 昜 is taken in one view to be 日 66 ‘sun’; Katō considers the lower elements to be 丂 130 (‘floating aquatic plant’, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise’, together with 彡 115 ‘feathers, colored feathers’, the latter representing colored (reflected) rays of the sun. According to Katō, the overall meaning then becomes ‘colors/brilliance of the risen morning sun’; ‘rise up’ is an extended sense. Another analysis takes the top part of 昜 as ‘jade disc/precious stone on a stand’, with rays of reflected light (Shirakawa), leading to ‘raise up (as an offering)’. The meaning ‘fry’ is probably loan usage, though it may possibly relate to raising some food item from a vat, which would suggest an extended meaning.

The graph 羔 is made up of 羊 426 (‘sheep’, slightly abbreviated to ), combined with 灬 ( 火 ) 8, ‘fire’ making it a distinct possibility that ‘roast a lamb’ may have been the original meaning, then generalized to ‘roast, bake’, but most commentators do not favor this analysis, probably in part at least because Shuowen defines 羔 as ‘newborn lamb’. Amniotic fluid takes its name from the Greek term amnos (lamb), and features in some graphs relating to human birth (see 432), so it is tempting to interpret the four dots in the modern form as droplets of amniotic fluid. However, the seal form above shows clearly that it is definitely the fire determinative. Shirakawa supports ‘newborn lamb’ on the basis of certain seal forms, the shape of which might be interpreted as ‘lamb/sheep standing’. Note, though, that Ma and Gu give much older OBI forms that clearly have 火 as the bottom element. A later popular variant of 窯 is 窰 , with ‘bake pottery/earthenware’ (CO; see 2052 Note) as the lower element. OT1968:743; SS1984:852,302-3; MR2007:294; GY2008:1121.

Leaving aside initially the top element 尸 (256 ‘corpse’, ‘person lying down’: see below), there is general agreement regarding the element 舟 1450 (‘boat’), namely that here it represents boat-shaped footwear. This combines with 彳 131 ‘road; go’, and an element for ‘foot’ here typically identified by scholars as 夊 , which is often interpreted as ‘drag the foot’ (see Appendix). These three elements contribute to an overall meaning ‘walk (slowly) dragging the feet wearing shoes/clogs’ (‘wooden shoes’, i.e. ‘clogs’ is favored by Katō). The top element 尸 (‘corpse’, also meanings including ‘substitute person for deceased’ [in a ritual context]) is treated in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘drag’ (Katō, Mizukami). Alternatively, 尸 here is taken not as phonetic but semantic as ‘substitute person for the deceased ’, and the whole graph is considered in this view originally to have referred to the wearing of shoes (made not of wood but of fabric) when conducting a ritual (Shirakawa). The two similarly-shaped ‘foot’ elements 夂 and 夊 appear to have given rise to a degree of confusion and fluctuation over the centuries, and 履 is a case in point: clerical script occurrences predominantly have the ‘foot’ element changed from 夊 to 夂 (assuming one accepts that the element here was originally 夊 ), and in terms of overall shape the graph was moving towards its modern form at that stage. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. ‘Act’ is probably an extended sense. MS1995:v1:412-4; DJ2009:v2:692; KJ1970:296-7; SS1984:872; SK1984:244.

The above explanation relates to the seal form. Mizukami proposes OBI equivalents also, though his analysis relates to the seal form, and he regards ‘become separated’ as a loan use.

Qiu indicates that old (e.g. clerical script) forms of 隆 with 土 ‘earth’ in place of 生 do exist, which he takes as consisting of 土 combined with 降 as phonetic in function.

Gu makes a broadly similar analysis, but takes 虍 as having a semantic as well as phonetic function (‘violent, savage’), and originally meaning ‘take by force’, with ‘capture’ as an extended sense. Note: OBI occurrences of 毌 ‘pierce, penetrate’ are taken in one interpretation as representing a shield, or alternatively as shells (shell currency) pierced and strung together on a length of string (both given in Mizukami). It might be tempting to take the line through the shield as indicating ‘pierce a shield’, but in all cases the line is horizontal or vertical in relation to the shield, suggesting orderly construction rather than invasive piercing (in the latter case, one would tend to expect a diagonal piercing line). N.B. 毌 should be distinguished from another graph very similar in shape, viz. 毋 , originally standing for a word meaning ‘do not violate woman’, then borrowed for ‘there is none, do not…’. 毌 1148 was more distinct in shape in OBI and bronze, while 毋 ‘do not violate woman’ only became distinct in shape from 母 222 ‘mother’ from seal onwards.

Alternatively, based on one of the bronze forms for 粦 , another commentator interprets the top element differently as 大 56 (‘big’) representing ‘person’, and takes the short dot-like strokes as drops of blood dripping down, with overall meaning ‘human sacrifice made before ladder for deities (to descend and ascend)’ (Shirakawa). The latter view is based in part on Shirakawa’s idiosyncratic interpretation of left-hand 阝 (abbreviated form of 阜 1907 when occurring as left-hand element), which is usually taken to mean ‘hill, mound, etc.’.

Zhengzitong (1771) treats 勵 as a popular variant. 勵 was, though, given official status in Japan in the first Jōyō kanji List of 1923; this was replaced by 励 in the Tōyō kanji list of 1946.

The traditional interpretation ( Shuowen ) is that this graph, comprising 犬 19 ‘dog’ with 戸 120 ‘door’, represents a dog twisting and turning to get under a door or entrance, and this is followed by several scholars (Ogawa, Katō). Katō takes ‘go back’ as an extended sense deriving from a dog going back – i.e. return – to its original shape (posture) after getting under a door. However, this proposed Shuowen -based etymology seems questionable. An alternative proposal by Shirakawa takes as showing a dog buried beneath an entrance as a preventative spell. A further analysis treats it as 犬 , with 戸 as phonetic with associated sense ‘shut in’, giving ‘wild/rampaging dog is shut in (by entrance)’, and by extension ‘act contrary to, go against’ (noted in Mizukami). Etymology of this graph is debated; Schuessler has ‘arrive, reach, settle’ as possible meanings for 戻 in a word-family related to 来 237 ‘come’ (as opposed to ‘return’).

Also used in Qin and Han dynasties as a term for low-ranking officials in charge of prisoners. The script used (though not actually devised) by them for administrative purposes, significantly abbreviated from the seal script, came to be known as 隷書 REISHO (Ch. lishu ), usually in English called ‘clerical script’ or ‘scribe script’. Clerical script represents an important stage in the historical development of the Chinese script. Clerical script occurrences of this graph have both 隸 and 隷 ; historically speaking, the latter is a variant form, but now the standard in Japanese usage. Note: several scholars give a pre-seal form, but its status is questionable, and so we take the seal form as the correct early form (as does Katō). MS1995:v2:1404-5; KJ1970:916; QX2000:103-112. Suggest taking 隶 as 肀 hand seizing, 氺 as (sweat) droplets, and left-hand as 士 ‘samurai’ 521 and 示 ‘show’ 723.",

Another scholar (Ogawa) analyses the graph differently, taking 齒 as ‘age, years’ (presumably as extended sense), with 令 as phonetic with associated sense ‘pass, elapse’, giving overall meaning ‘age’.

In similar vein, Ogawa takes 厤 as phonetic with associated sense ‘divide up equally’, to give ‘(device) for counting by arranging/setting out days’, i.e. ‘calendar’. According to Qiu, 曆 was devised to represent unambiguously in writing the word for‘calendar’, which had until then been represented using 歴 636 (path/movement followed by sun and other heavenly bodies at regular intervals). Shirakawa, by contrast, puts forward several proposed bronze forms for 曆 /暦 which feature not 日 ‘sun, day’ but 曰 1048 ‘speak’, which he interprets as ‘announce on banner military prowess at camp gates’. The form 暦 , now standard in Japanese usage, evolved as relatively late variant (block script stage). Note: 秝 (CO; reduplication of 禾 87 ‘grain plant’) is taken in one view as ‘arrange grain seedlings equidistantly’ or ‘arranged properly’ (Mizukami). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes 秝 to represent grain plants placed to mark the entrance to a military camp. KJ1970:921; OT1968:474; MS1995:v1:186-7,v2:966-7; QX2000:357; OT1968:474; SS1984:902-3.
