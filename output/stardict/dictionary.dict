Examples:
  • 一月 [ICHIGATSU] - January
  • 均一 [KIN’ITSU] - uniformity

References: SS1984:36; BK1957:261-2; KJ1970:38; AS2007:581-2.

Examples:

Etymology: OBI . Based on a conceptual depiction of rain, falling from the sky which is represented by a top horizontal line, though this line is often missing in the OBI and bronze forms. The graph can also indicate weather elements. References: SS1984:38; QX2000:208.

<b>円</b>
Reading: EN, maru
Meaning: round, yen
Strokes: 4
Level: L5
Number: 4

Examples:
  • 円形 [ENKEI] - circle
  • 百円 [HYAKUEN] - hundred yen

Etymology: The modern simplified form of 圓 , a relatively late graph ( Shuowen ) which consists of 囗 (regularized shape for ‘circle’) with 員 248 (‘official’, originally ‘cauldron’) as phonetic; included by Tōdō in word-family meaning ‘round; surround’. 円 may be based on a cursive form of 圓 . References: YK1976:69; TA1965:63-4. We suggest taking the graph as resembling a bank teller’s window.
<b>王</b>
Reading: Ō
Meaning: king, ruler
Strokes: 4
Level: L3
Number: 5

Examples:
  • 王子 [ŌJI] - prince
  • 女王 [JOŌ] - queen
  • 王様 [Ōsama] - king

Etymology: OBI shows this graph to be based on a battle-ax blade. Shirakawa feels the OBI and bronze equivalents show a ritual blade of a type used only by those of high status such as a ruler. Qiu notes that at the seal script stage the character 王 and another separate character meaning ‘jewel’ were written so similarly that they could easily be confused, so a dot was added later for clarity when writing ‘jewel’ (see 玉 15). References: SS1984:62-3; QX2000:46.

<b>音</b>

Meaning: sound
Strokes: 9
Level: L4
Number: 6

Examples:
  • 音楽 [ONGAKU] - music
  • 子音 [SHIIN] - consonant
  • 発音 [HATSUON] - pronunciation

Etymology: Precise etymology disputed. Early bronze equivalent . The lower element is interpreted either as a mouth (Karlgren, Katō) or as a prayer receptacle. Shirakawa takes the latter view, and maintains that the (extra) horizontal stroke inside the receptacle represents a written prayer. Katō regards 音 and 言 (see ‘word’, 118) as having been used interchangeably in ancient times, though Karlgren treats them as having been separate. References: BK1957:173, 80; KJ1970:68; SS1984:68. We suggest taking 立 as ‘rising’ 77 and 日 as ‘sun’ 66.

<b>下</b>
Reading: KA, GE, shita, moto, shimo, sa

Strokes: 3
Level: L5
Number: 7

Examples:
  • 下品 [GEHIN] - vulgarity
  • 低下 [TEIKA] - decrease
  • 川下 [kawashimo] - downstream

Etymology: OBI . Mizukami suggests the curve was to help distinguish this character from early forms of 二 65 (‘two’). At some point, a vertical stroke was added beneath the longer horizontal. Qiu feels this change was also for graphic distinction – in this case from the early forms of 上 39 (‘above’), which was written with a short horizontal stroke over a longer one to represent ‘go up, above’. Shirakawa takes the longer horizontal line in early forms as depicting the palm of the hand (in profile). References: BK1957:28; QX2000:46; MS1983:151; SS1984:69.

<b>花</b>

Strokes: 7
Level: L4
Number: 9

Examples:
  • 花弁 [KABEN] - petal
  • 花見 [hanami] - blossom viewing
  • 花火 [hanabi] - fireworks

Etymology: A late character. The top element is the typical abbreviation 艹 of the ‘plant’ determinative 艸 53 (itself based on a pictograph of plants growing), while the lower element 化 ‘change’ (see 258), serves as phonetic (associated sense here disputed), and is a pointer to the reading, which in modern Sino-Japanese is KA (also a phonetic indicator in 貨 KA 455, etc.). According to Shirakawa, the graph 花 was probably not devised in China until the early 5th century AD; Katō gives a wider timeframe, viz the Six Dynasties period (ca. 222-589AD). References: SS1984:72; KJ1970:315.

  • 空箱 [karabako] - empty box

Etymology: Bronze . The top five strokes (of the modern form) depict the entrance to a hollowed-out pit, or cave 穴 860, i.e., something empty; subsequently extended to mean ‘sky’. The lower element 工 125 (‘work, tool’) serves as a phonetic, with an associated sense of ‘hole’. References: SS1984:220; KJ1970:401; MS1995:v2:974-5. We suggest remembering by using 工 in its meaning of ‘work’.

Examples:

  • 強盗 [GŌTŌ] - burglar/burglary
  • 強み [tsuyomi] - strong point

Etymology: Seal . According to Qiu, 强 (a variant of 強 ; standard in PRC usage) originally refers to type of ‘insect’ 虫 60, but came to be used as substitute for another graph of more complex shape, i.e. 彊 . In part, this was because pronunciation for the two words concerned in early Chinese represented by 強 / 强 and 彊 was identical, if we accept Schuessler’s reconstruction of sound values. Latter graph is made up of 弓 ’bow’ 107 and two ‘field’ graphs 田 63 with three straight dividing lines (note that as independent graph this component here had the sense of ‘boundary’). The meaning of 彊 , first found in OBI texts, is tentatively taken as ‘strong bow’ by Tōdō, who sees ‘unmoving’ – and thereby ‘strong’ – as extended senses of ‘boundary’. As for 弓 , it is thought that the bow, being of standard length, may have had the additional role of being a convenient tool for making land measurements. QX2000:358; AS2007:427; MR2007:484; TA1965:394-5. Suggest taking ム as a nose.

Etymology: Seal forms , . Relatively late origin ( Shuowen ). Interpretations vary. Has 彡 ‘color, brush pattern’ (etc.) (determinative no. 59), and left-hand element identical with or close in shape to 井 1575 ‘well’. In one view, taken as consisting of 彡 meaning ‘writing brush hairs’, and 开 as phonetic with associated sense ‘imitate, model after’, giving ‘model, copy’ (Katō). Another analysis treats as 彡 ‘pattern’, and 开 / 井 as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘square frame’, giving ‘mold (to make copies)’ (Tōdō). Shirakawa also sees 开 / 井 as representing a frame or mold. TA1965:501-3; SS1984:227; KJ1970:359; KJ1985:214.

Etymology: Late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form has 糸 29 ‘thread’ as semantic, and 囟 (CO originally a pictograph of skull or fontanelle) as phonetic, with associated sense ‘thin, slender’. The change from 囟 to 田 in standard script is due either to script regularization or mistaken analysis. KJ1970:469; YK1976:198; SS1984:338. We suggest taking 田 as 63 ‘field’.

Etymology: Originally the graph was just 乍 , with OBI forms such as showing what is seen as timber being cut with an ax. Some bronze forms have a hand appended; later this was dropped, and the ‘person’ determinative 亻 41 was added. ‘To make’ evolved as an extended meaning. As the phonetic in 作 , 乍 also has associated sense of ‘modified, not genuine’ (cf English ‘made up’). MS1995:v1:18-20, 54; KJ1970:435-6; OT1968:25,53. We suggest taking 乍 as a saw.

Level: L3
Number: 149

Examples:

Etymology: Mizukami takes bronze forms to combine ‘hand’ 920 寸 orig. ‘hand’, with 止 143 ‘stop’, latter acting as phonetic with associated sense ‘control’; Katō broadly agrees. Ogawa identifies same two elements as ‘keep in the hand’. Instead of 止 , Tōdō takes top element as 之 (NJK; ‘move, go’, see 151). Note some OBI and bronze forms of 止 and 之 are very similar ( 之 might originally have depicted foot, like 止 ); Karlgren asserts 止 ‘is mostly used in the bone and the bronze inscriptions as loan for the homophonous 之 in its various meanings’ (Schuessler has these two graphs as near-homophones, not complete homophones in Late Han times). Originally meaning ‘control with hand’, in Han times 寺 acquired the sense of ‘place to control/administer’, and also – after transmission of Buddhism to China c.1 st century A.D. – the more specialized sense of ‘Buddhist temple’. By clerical script stage upper element had changed to 土 . MS1995:v1:392-3,18-19; KJ1970:480; OT1968:285; BK1957:253-4; AS2007:613; SK1984:230. Take as 土 64 ‘ground’ and 寸 920 ‘hand’.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 數 . Has 攵 ( 攴 normally ‘beat, strike’ 112, but here ‘do something with the hands’), and 婁 (CO; ‘sorceress’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘count out loud’ (Katō), or ‘be linked’ (Mizukami). Shirakawa, though, takes the graph as originally depicting a woman with a chignon, which is then dishevelled by someone’s hands ( 攵 ) to denote ‘blame, reproach’ (now a minor meaning in Chinese). MS1995:v1:582-3,336-7; KJ1970:499; SS1984:490-91. We suggest taking the modern form as 米 220 ‘rice’, 女 37 ‘woman’, and ‘use of hands’ 攵 112.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 臺 . Analyses differ. In one view, 壴 ‘big drum’ over 至 886 (‘arrive’) with the sense ‘foot, base’ gives ‘drum stand’ (Ogawa). In another view, upper element is taken as ‘watchtower’ over 至 meaning ‘stay’, giving ‘place to stay and watch out’, i.e. ‘watchtower’ (Mizukami). Later abbreviated shape 台 coincides with a separate graph 台 (originally ‘I, me’ [ 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, and 厶 ‘enclose and make one’s own’ as phonetic meaning ‘oneself’]).

Note: 也 was originally pictograph of a slithering snake or – in one view – female genitalia (noted in Mizukami); later borrowed for sound value for several grammatical function words such as ‘be’, ‘also’. MS1995:v1:264-5,24-5; KJ1970:692; TA1965:455-57.

Etymology: Seal . A late graph. Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and 矢 145 (‘arrow’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit the mark’, giving ‘describe spot-on/exactly (like a flying arrow to its target)’, and by extension ‘know’. Alternatively, Shirakawa takes ‘arrow’ as being linked to taking an oath to the deities, and interprets 口 22 in his more usual way as ‘receptacle’; ‘knowing’ is then taken as emerging from the process of oath-taking. 智 is a separate graph (NJK) also meaning ‘know’; lower element is originally not 日 66 ‘sun, day’, but NJK 曰 ‘speak’. MS1995:v2:930-31; TA1965:465-7; SS1984:587.

Etymology: Originally in OBI (corresponding to 毓 : see also 432), depicting ‘woman’ with ‘child’ (baby being born) with dots for amniotic fluid. An abbreviated form of the graph, with its modern structure, is found from the seal script stage, consisting of 子 27 ‘child’ but inverted, over 肉 209 ‘meat, flesh’ in its abbreviated form 月 , possibly as phonetic with associated sense ‘to be born’ (Yamada, Katō), but Tōdō considers 月 here to be semantic only. ‘Be raised/raise’ and ‘educate’ are extended meanings. MS1995:v2:1070-71; YK1976:57; KJ1970:52-3; TA1965:194.

Etymology: Seal . OBI form shows the graph was originally a three-legged cauldron topped by a circle, depicting a round-necked vessel. As in the seal form ( Shuowen ) and modern form, the lower element might appear to be 貝 10 ‘shell currency’, which is incorrect but may be a helpful mnemonic. The top element 口 22 ‘round’ is semantic, and Tōdō takes it in this role only; Mizukami, Katō, and Yamada choose to take it as phonetic with associated meaning ‘round’, as well as semantic. ‘Member’ and ‘official’ appear to be modern meanings. TA1965:611-23; MS1995:v1:228-30; KJ1970:63; YK1976:60-61.

Later, 食 ‘meal’ 163 was substituted as left-hand element. Earlier OBI form simply depicts person bending over wine barrel or similar to drink. YK1976:61; OT1968:533, 1026.

Etymology: OBI forms , . Traditional 溫 . Typically ed as quite late in origin. Seal form onwards consists of 氵 42 ‘water’, with as phonetic; generally, taken as associated sense unclear and the whole graph originally representing a specific river name, then loaned for ‘warm’. Mizukami, however, lists the above OBI forms as showing someone with water in a bath-like container, regards associated sense of the phonetic as ‘warm’, and takes the meaning as ‘river with warm current’ or ‘steamy warm water’. He also treats the same OBI form as the earliest form of 浴 625 ‘bathe’, listing different shapes for 温 and 浴 only at the seal stage. MS1995:V2,772-3; KJ1970:114; YK1976:76. We suggest taking the modern graph as 氵 42 ‘water’, 日 66 ‘sun’, and 皿 300 ‘bowl’.

Originally referred to the Han River (modern Shaanxi Province), one of the most important tributaries of the Yangtze River; later taken as name for the Han dynasty by its founder Liu Bang, as that region was where he began building the dynasty. At an early period, non-Han ethnic groups in China referred to Han Chinese as 漢 子 ‘sons of Han’, and by extension the general sense ‘male’. KJ1970:223; OT1968:599; YK1976:104; SS1984:128. We suggest taking the right hand element as 夫 601 ‘man’, 口 22 ‘mouth’ and 艹 53 ‘grass/plant’, with a little geographical licence.

Etymology: OBI ; bronze . Generally taken as 矢 145 ‘arrow’, with element for flagpole and streamer (modern form / : see also CO 斿 at 424) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sharp, pointed’. Originally meant ‘arrowhead’. ‘Family’ is a loan usage, and when this meaning became dominant, the metal determinative 金 16 was added to create a new graph 鏃 for ‘arrowhead’. MS1995:v1:604-5; KJ1970:649-50; YK1976:336. We suggest taking 方 as 223 ‘side’, and as 41 ‘person’.

  • 及第 [KYŪDAI] - making grade

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and a slightly abbreviated form of 弟 194 (‘younger brother’; qv) as phonetic with associated sense ‘order, sequence’, to give original meaning ‘put letters or records in order’. It subsequently acquired more general meaning of ‘order, sequence’, probably with a connotation of relative status, given other related words in Chinese noted by Schuessler such as those for ‘younger brother’ and possibly also ‘ladder’. Note: In Han times, strips of bamboo were commonly joined together – clearly reflected in the shape of the graph 冊 884 ‘bundle of bamboo tablets’ – to give a surface for writing. MS1995:v2:986-7; YK1976:348; OT1968:749; AS2007:210.

<b>題</b>

Level: L4
Number: 360

Examples:
  • 問題 [MONDAI] - problem, issue
  • 題名 [DAIMEI] - title
  • 話題 [WADAI] - topic

Etymology: Seal . Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 是 1574 (now ‘proper’, ‘this’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shave the head’; shaving the head gives impression of bigger forehead, hence the original meaning ‘forehead’. In ancient China, slaves’ foreheads were marked (tattooed) with a sign to show ownership, and from that there evolved the extended sense ‘title, heading’. KJ1970:712-3; YK1976:348; MS1995:v2:1450-51.

<b>炭</b>
Reading: TAN, sumi
Meaning: charcoal, coal
Strokes: 9
Level: L4
Number: 361

Examples:
  • 石炭 [TANSEKI] - coal
  • 炭素 [TANSO] - carbon
  • 炭火 [sumibi] - charcoal fire

Etymology: Seal . Generally taken as 火 8 ‘fire’ and 屵 as phonetic element with associated sense ‘return, go back’. Charcoal is wood that has been burned once (under controlled conditions) but can be burned again as fuel, hence the two graphic elements together meaning ‘fire returns’. As well as this interpretation, Mizukami sets out an alternative, taking 屵 semantically as ‘cliff, bluff’, to give ‘combustible material coming from a cliff or similar’, i.e. coal (as extended sense; also in modern Chinese [certain non-Mandarin dialects], 炭 can mean ‘coal’). MS1995:v2:796-7; KJ1970:678; YK1976:351.

  • 手短に [temijika ni] - in brief

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Katō and Yamada choose to take 矢 145 ‘arrow’ as an abbreviation of the NJK 矩 ‘carpenter’s square’, with 豆 379 (‘upright vessel’, now ‘bean’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘small’, to give overall meaning such as ‘small in measure, short in stature’. Ogawa, though, takes 矢 literally as ‘arrow’, and 豆 as phonetic with associated sense ‘small’, to give ‘short arrow’. Either way, the resultant meaning evolved as just ‘short’. KJ1970:683; YK1976:351-2; OT1968:706.

  • 注釈 [CHŪSHAKU] - notes (text)

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 主 315 (now ‘main/master’ but originally a stemmed lamp) as phonetic with associated sense ‘continue’, to give meaning ‘continuation of water droplets’ (Katō, Ogawa). An alternative analysis is given by Tōdō, who includes 注 in his word-family ‘stand firmly/upright’ on the basis that water pouring down can be seen as a vertical column. The early meaning of 主 is stemmed lamp, and this may reinforce ‘column’. KJ1970:506-7; YK1976:362; OT1968:567; TA1965:281-4.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Generally taken as 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, with 長 189 ‘long’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull taut’ (later 張 775), originally referring to a curtain pulled around a bed as a screen; Tōdō, in contrast, includes 帳 in a word-family meaning ‘long’, to give ‘long hanging cloth’. Not clear whether the sense ‘record book/accounts book’ is an extended usage (records written on cloth?) or a loan usage. KJ1970:702-3; YK1976:366; OT1968:318; TA1965:348-9.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words, language’, and 周 532 (‘around’), here as phonetic with associated sense ‘harmonise’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘extend thoroughly’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Though these two interpretations of the phonetic differ, the former is in line with the modern Japanese meaning totonoeru ‘arrange’, the latter with shiraberu ‘investigate’. KJ1970:514; YK1976:369; OT1968:935; TA1965:179-83.

Level: L3
Number: 372

Examples:

  • 庭園 [TEIEN] - garden
  • 庭師 [niwaSHI] - master gardener

Etymology: Seal . Has 广 127 ‘house, building’, and 廷 1742 (‘imperial court’), here as phonetic with associated sense ‘extend/spread in a straight line/evenly’ (Mizukami, Tōdō). Originally, the building was typically a palace, and the graph referred to a level open space in a courtyard where people often gathered for formal occasions. Used with a similar meaning historically in Japan, but then also came to denote ‘garden’. MS1995:454-5; TA1965:455-59; OT1968:329.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 由 421 (‘reason’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘extract’ (Tōdō, Ogawa) or ‘clear’ (Katō); Tōdō takes it as extracting the material from inside the bamboo joints to make it hollow, while Katō takes as meaning a flute which produces clear sound. TA1965:185-90; OT1968:749; KJ1970:720.

Number: 374

Examples:
  • 鉄板 [TEPPAN] - iron/steel plate
  • 地下鉄 [CHIKATETSU] - subway
  • 鉄橋 [TEKKYŌ] - iron bridge

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 鐵 . Generally taken as 金 16 ‘metal’, with (CO ‘big’) (the minor change from 大 56 [‘big’] in top of seal form to 十 35 [‘ten’] in block script is not significant) as phonetic with associated sense range ‘black soil, black, reddish-black’ (Mizukami, Yamada, Ogawa), though Katō regards the right-hand element as having semantic and phonetic role, meaning ‘big’. In favour of interpretation of right-hand element as ‘black, reddish black’ here is the existence of a related word in Chinese of the same or similar pronunciation represented by the graph 驖 meaning ‘reddish-black horse’. The black or reddish-black metal is usually taken as ‘iron’, which takes on a reddish-black colour when rusted. MS1995:v2:1378-9; YK1976:377; OT1968:1040; KJ1970:723; ZY2009:v4:1560.

Strokes: 9

Number: 377

Examples:
  • 程度 [TEIDO] - degree
  • 温度 [ONDO] - temperature
  • 一度 [ICHIDO] - once

Etymology: Seal (bronze similar). Taken as 又 2003 ‘hand’, with abbreviated form of 庶 1480 (‘many’) (Katō, Yamada, Tōdō) – or variant of 石 47 (‘stone’) – (Ogawa) as a phonetic, both with ngers of same associated sense ‘spread out fingers of the hand’, to give ‘measure with the hand’. The hand, with spread-out thumb and middle finger, was moved from one point to the next as a rough way of measuring a short distance. Later took on a generalized meaning ‘measure’ and not just linear, hence ‘degree’, etc. KJ1970:612; YK1976:383-4; TA1965:332-5; OT1968:156. We suggest taking 广 127 as ‘building’ and central part as two ‘tens’ 十 35 with ‘one’ 一 1.

Level: L1
Number: 379

Examples:
  • 豆腐 [TŌFU] - tofu (beancurd)
  • 大豆 [DAIZU] - soybean
  • 豆本 [mameHON] - miniature book

Etymology: OBI form ; seal . Originally a pictograph of a round vessel on a stem (varied in height) with a splayed foot, to serve meat or other food; later, some such vessels (Ch. dou ) served a ritual purpose. In Tōdō’s word-family ‘stand upright’. The graph seems to have been borrowed to represent a different word (of same pronunciation in Han times) meaning ‘bean, soybean’; the meaning ‘small’ may be an extended use from ‘bean’ (something small). KJ1970:733-4; MR2007:314; QX2000:179,356; TA1965:281-3; SS1984:642; AS2007:215-6. We suggest taking the top lateral stroke as ‘one’ 一 (1).

Examples:
  • 一等 [ITTŌ] - first class
  • 上等 [JŌTŌ] - high class
  • 等圧線 [TŌATSUSEN] - isobar

Etymology: Seal . Late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, here denoting bamboo writing tablet, and 寺 149 (‘temple’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘arrange, put in order’. Similar to 第 359 ‘order’, but regarding the additional sense ‘equal’ which 等 has, Shirakawa cites a pre-modern Chinese commentary which explains this on the basis of sorting out big and small bamboo writing tablets, resulting in groups of tablets of equal size; if we accept this explanation, ‘etc. (et cetera)’ – meaning the inclusion of further similar items – can be regarded as an extended sense. KJ1970:482; YK1976:389; SS1984:648.

<b>童</b>

Level: L3
Number: 385

Examples:
  • 童話 [DŌWA] - nursery tale
  • 児童 [JIDŌ] - children
  • 童心 [DŌSHIN] - child’s mind

Etymology: Bronze . Seal . Bronze form has 辛 1535 ‘needle’ over 重 326 (‘heavy’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘slave’, also with 目 76 ‘eye’ added in the middle. In ancient China, slaves were tattooed on the forehead with a needle to indicate ownership, and ‘eye’ here is taken to denote forehead, the eye being much easier to represent pictographically. There is debate over this graph’s diff erent meanings ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’. Qiu observes that in ancient texts 童 represented both ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’, and that by the time of Shuowen the NJK graph 僮 had been devised to create the orthographically contrastive pair 童 ‘slave, servant’ as opposed to 僮 ‘child’, but even after that 童 was still often used for ‘child’, and likewise 僮 has meanings of both ‘child’ and ‘servant’. In early Chinese, the associated words for ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’ appear to have been of the same pronunciation, assuming they were in fact separate words (Schuessler lists them together as one entry). Aesthetically a displeasing graph at bronze stage because it consists of multiple elements one on top of the other; this visual imbalance became moderated at the seal script stage. MS1995:v2:984-5; KJ1970:735; YK1976:392; QX2000:350-51; AS2007:500. Take modern graph as 立 77 ‘stand’ and 里 238 ‘village’.

Etymology: Seal ; a relatively late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 相 348 (‘mutual’) as a phonetic with associated sense ‘face each other’, which is taken as referring to the long rails on either side of an oxcart. The graph 箱 was originally used to denote the part of an ox-cart used for carrying goods (Katō, Shirakawa), and since this was box-like in shape, by extension the meaning ‘box’ evolved. MS1995:990-91; KJ1970:551; SS1984:548.

MS1995:v2:1522-3; YK1976:425; OT1968:1171. Suggest 自 as ‘nose’, 田 as 田 63 ‘field’, and lower part as two ‘tens’ 十 35.

  • 時刻表 [JIKOKUHYŌ] - timetable

Etymology: Seal . Has 衣 444 ‘clothing’, and 毛 230 ‘fur, hair’. The function of the element 毛 is disputed: taken either as phonetic with associated sense ‘envelop, enclose’, to give ‘outer garment to cover inside’ (Katō, Mizukami, Yamada), or as semantic and interpreted as a garment worn over a fur coat (Mizukami, Qiu). The meanings ‘front, surface; show’ are extended usages. KJ1970:843-4; MS1995:v2:1164-5; YK1976:427; QX2000:20. Suggest take the top part as odd variant of ‘master’ 主 315, with ‘clothing’ 衣 .

The sense ‘small’ was then extended to small units, giving ‘second’ in the dimension of time. KJ1970:847; YK1976:429; OT1968:731.

Number: 407

Examples:
  • 部分 [BUBUN] - part
  • 部長 [BUCHŌ] - head of division
  • 部屋 [heya*] - room

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has right-hand determinative 阝 376 (full form: 邑 ), ‘village, settlement’, and 咅 ‘spit’ (see 389), here as phonetic with disputed associated sense. Katō and Yamada feel sense unclear as originally 部 was a proper noun for a tribe in western China, and treat it as loan usage for ‘part, section’. Tōdō, however, includes 部 in a word-family ‘oppose; divide’, linking it to a word later written 剖 1975 ‘cut, split open’. Shirakawa also takes the sense as ‘divide’. KJ1970:759; YK1976:435; TA1965:155-8; SS1984:745-6. Suggest taking 咅 as 立 77 ‘stand’ and 口 22 ‘mouth’.

(originally a woman striving to give birth; now meaning ‘avoid, escape’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘be born’. Along the same lines, Tōdō notes 免 as the original way of writing NJK 娩 ‘childbirth’, and includes it in the word-family ‘take out/produce with great effort’. The graph 勉 thus has the meaning ‘make an effort, strive’. KJ1970:854; YK1976:449; TA1965:739-41.

Number: 421

Examples:

  • 自由 [JIYŪ] - freedom

Etymology: Seal . Etymology disputed. Katō and Yamada treat as originally same graph as 西 169 (later divergence in shape), showing basket/bag for pressing out liquid in wine-making. Shirakawa sees early forms of 由 as the same as for 卣 (‘small-necked wine jar’), which he takes as initially showing a fleshy gourd that produced a form of oil (see 油 422 ‘oil’). Ogawa also treats 卣 and 由 as having same early forms. Differences in analysis of early forms of 由 reflect difficulties often found in deciding which old forms correspond to which modern graphs. The abstract meanings for 由 such as ‘from’ may be taken as loan usages. KJ1970:24; YK1976:476; SS1984:829; OT1968:669,144. Take as 田 63 ‘field’ and l as a drill.

  • 羊皮 [YŌHI] - sheepskin
  • 羊水 [YŌSUI] - amniotic fluid
  • 羊飼い [hitsujikai] - shepherd

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Originally a pictograph showing head and horns of a sheep; as Ma observes, this stands for the whole animal. Katō and Mizukami follow the view in Shuowen that the tail is shown also, though the longish line in some OBI occurrences could represent the body instead. In compound graphs, the shortened form is often used. MR2007:293-4; YK1976:482; KJ1970:875; MS1995:v2:1038-9.

Has 艹 53 plant/grass, and 枼 (OBI form ; a CO that originally represented thin flat leaves on tree branches, later stylized to 世 344 ‘generation’ qv and 木 73 ‘tree’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘thin and flat’. In Tōdō’s word-family ‘thin’. He suggests that the (lesser and now rare) sense ‘generation, age’ is a metaphoric use based on layers of leaves one on top of the other. OT1968:863; MS1995:v1:662; TA1965:831-3.

Examples:
  • 仕様 [SHIYŌ] - way, means
  • 有様 [arisama] - situation
  • 皆様 [minasama] - everyone (polite)

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 樣 ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and what is generally taken as 羕 (originally pictograph of big river with tributaries) as phonetic. Yamada takes 羕 as having associated sense ‘resemble’, and Katō says it may have this meaning, but despite the connection with appearance, both consider ‘appearance/form’ as loan usage. Ogawa takes 樣 to be a variant of the NJK 橡 ‘horse chestnut’ or ‘oak’, and likewise takes 様 as a loan for ‘appearance’. As for the use of 様 for‘ –sama ’ as a polite suffix, there was an independent Japanese word sama ‘condition/appearance/shape’, found from about the tenth century, sometimes written as 様 , and its use in modern Japanese for ‘ –sama ’ as a suffix may be regarded as a loan usage. YK1976:485; KJ1970:875; OT1968:519. We suggest taking the elements as 木 73 ‘tree’, 羊 426 ‘sheep’, and 水 42 ‘water’.

Etymology: Bronze ; seal ; traditional form: 兩 . A variant of , depicting a gourd split in half (not quite completely), with the short curved lines inside representing membranes.

Shuowen takes it instead as pictographically representing a pair of scales, but modern scholars consider this analysis carries no weight – though perhaps useful as a mnemonic.

Etymology: OBI ; seal ; traditional 綠 . Seal form onwards has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 䩑 (CO; OBI and bronze forms of the latter are typically taken as originally a pictograph showing wine being strained and dripping down), the latter as phonetic with associated sense ‘verdigris’, including its color. (Verdigris is a bluish-green coating which comes out of copper and forms on its surface; later written 録 640 qv [the meaning ‘record, make a copy’ is a later loan usage].) The overall meaning of 緑 was originally ‘silk the color of verdigris’; later it was used for just the color itself. KJ1970:932,931; YK1976:499; MS1995:v2:1018-9,v1:474-5. We suggest taking 䩑 as a hand ヨ squeezing liquid/water (see 水 42 ‘water’).

Level: L3
Number: 437

Examples:
  • 列車 [RESSHA] - train
  • 列次 [RETSUJI] - sequence
  • 前列 [ZENRETSU] - front row

Etymology: Seal . Has 刂 198 ‘knife, cut’, and an early form (see 302), interpreted as skeletal remains (possibly this depicted just the occipital bone, which forms back and base of skull and encircles top of spinal cord, to represent a complete skeleton); in later stages of the script this changed in shape through to become 歹 . The latter element serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘separate, cleave’. There was a set order to cutting up an animal into pieces, often arranged in a row, and so the meaning of this graph was extended to ‘row, line, order’. MS1995:v1:126-7; YK1976:503-4, 312; KJ1970:922.

The meaning was then modified from ‘work/process silk thread’ to ‘attain skill in a task, practice’. KJ1970:648; MS1995:v1:658-9; YK1976:504-5; OT1968:784.

Examples:
  • 愛情 [AIJŌ] - love
  • 母性愛 [BOSEIAI] - maternal love
  • 愛国者 [AIKOKUSHA] - patriot

Etymology: Seal ; traditional ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. There are several complicating factors with the etymology of this graph, explained below. Analyzed by Yamada as 夊 in line with the seal form (‘walk slowly, drag feet’ [determinative 35; see Appendix]), with (an obsolete graph meaning ‘favor, feel compassion’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘by stealth’, to give overall meaning ‘walk stealthily’; Katō sees this tentatively as the possible meaning also. Both scholars regard ‘love’ as a loan usage. Mizukami notes an alternative analysis: 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ with 夂 ‘descending foot’ (determinative 34) and 旡 (originally, pictograph of person who has eaten till full) ‘be full; stick in the throat’; overall meaning is ‘difficult to move forward with heart full of anguish’, and ‘love’ as loan usage. Note this analysis has 夂 ‘descending foot’, but treats as meaning 夊 ‘walk slowly’. Morohashi quotes the voluminous 17 th century dictionary Zhengzitong in treating as the original way of writing 愛 . He makes no mention of loan usage for ‘love’, though it would appear to be valid to take ‘love’ as an extension of ‘favor, feel compassion’, the original meaning of . YK1976:49; KJ1970:1-2; MT1989:v4:980, 1123; MS1995:v1:513-4. Note: for more on 夂 and 夊 see Appendix. We suggest taking 夂 as crossed legs, 爫 1739 as ‘hand’, 冖 as cover, and 心 164 ‘heart’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 安 242 (‘relax’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘place, put’, to represent a small table on which tableware and food were put. Meanings such as ‘investigate’, ‘consider’, ‘plan’ are loan usages (Yamada). Art dating back to the Shang Dynasty shows that low tables were in use in China at that period already.

Examples:

  • 位置 [ICHI] - situation, position

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Mizukami and Yamada say 位 and 立 77 ‘stand (/ up)’ were originally the same graph, but the situation would be better expressed as ‘originally (in Chinese) 立 represented two separate but related words’, one meaning ‘stand, stand up’, the other meaning ‘position or place (in a court or group of persons)’. For this latter meaning, the separate graph with 亻 41 ‘person’ added as left-hand component was devised at the seal stage. Yamada takes as 亻 ‘person’ with 立 , the latter functioning as both semantic and phonetic meaning ‘people lined up’, to give an overall meaning of ‘place where people stand’; Katō is in agreement.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 艹 53 ‘plant’, and 央 254 ‘center’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘blossom’, and by extension ‘beautiful, excellent’. The sense ‘Britain’ reflects the adoption by the Chinese of this graph for its sound value ( ying ) to represent the Chinese version of ‘England’, i.e. 英 国 Yingguo ). The choice of 英 seems to show a positive view of England/Britain at the time. YK1976:65; KJ1970:77; OT1968:846.

Level: L3
Number: 451

Examples:
  • 食塩 [SHOKUEN] - table salt
  • 塩水 [shiomizu] - saltwater
  • 製塩所 [SEIENSHO] - saltworks

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 鹽 . Traditional form has 鹵 , based on pictograph of salt or salty soil contained in a basket-like container, and 監 1159 (‘watch’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bitter’ (Katō, Yamada); Schuessler, though, considers the proposed associated sense ‘bitter’ as unlikely here, on linguistic grounds. Ogawa, by contrast, takes the sense of the phonetic as ‘soak in water’, namely seawater. This is noted tentatively as a possibility by Mizukami also, who gives a bronze equivalent that includes 氵 42 ‘water’ as an additional component, though the ‘water’ component here could alternatively reflect part of a process for obtaining salt (‘rock salt’) from salty soil. Salt was an important trading commodity in ancient China, as in other ancient civilisations, due in part to its preserving qualities. The modern (block script) form has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, reflecting that one salt production method was from the ground. The right-hand side is a simplified modification in shape to the upper right and lower elements of the traditional form (examples of the simplified right-hand side can be found in Han time clerical script). KJ1970:105; YK1976:71; OT1968:1158; MS1995:v2:1502-3; AS2007:554; WM1974:121. Suggest taking four components: 土 64 ‘ground’, 41 ‘person’, 口 22 ‘mouth’, and 皿 300 ‘dish ‘.

Examples:
  • 二億 [NIOKU] - 200 million

  • 億兆 [OKUCHŌ] - ‘the masses’

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’ and 意 246 (‘thought’) as semantic and phonetic with associated meaning ‘heart is full, content’ (Ogawa), giving overall meaning ‘satisfied person’. The meaning ‘one hundred million/extremely large number’ (originally ‘one hundred thousand’) is loan usage. Based on the seal form Yamada feels that the standard script form of 億 should properly be (‘satisfied’), but Kangxi zidian quotes the 11th century Jiyun dictionary, which says that this latter graph and 億 are the same. OT1968:81; KJ1970:300-01; YK1976:74-5; ZY2009:v1:48.

Etymology: OBI ; seal . OBI form depicts fruit on 木 73 ‘tree’. Seal script has what seems to be 田 63 ‘field’, but this is generally taken as fruit (Yamada says fruit with streaks), to give overall meaning ‘small fruit on a tree’. ‘Carry out’ and ‘result’ are extended meanings.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 貝 10 ‘shell/currency’, and 化 258 (‘change’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘change’, to give overall sense ‘currency changes into something different’ or ‘something exchanged with money’; and by extension, ‘treasure, wealth, assets’. This graph is seen on one category of very early inscribed items found in Japan (sites in Nagasaki Prefecture) – coins brought over from China dating back to the early 1 st century AD which in seal script read 貨泉 ‘coinage’ ( 泉 926 ‘spring’, here serves as loan for 銭 757 ‘copper coin, money’).

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words/speech’, and 果 454 (‘fruit/result’) as phonetic with associated sense i] ‘consider, test’ (Katō, Yamada), to give ‘consider one’s words’; or ii] ‘divide’ (Ogawa), to give ‘divide up work and test what is done’. If Ogawa’s interpretation is followed, the division of work, which would involve allocation, and often a degree of sequencing, may be seen as having given rise to extended meanings such as ‘levy’, ‘section’, ‘lesson’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 戒 1095 (‘warn, admonish’ qv) functioning here either semantically to mean ‘admonish’, to give an overall meaning of ‘wooden item used to admonish’, i.e. handcuffs or shackles, or phonetically with an associated sense of ‘device, tool’, to give ‘wooden device/tool’. The latter sense may be regarded as a generalised meaning based on the former. KJ1970:147; YK1976:90; OT1968:506. Again we suggest two mnemonics, one using 戒 as it stands, with its meaning of ‘admonish,’ and one breaking it down to its component parts: 戈 545 ‘halberd’ with indicating two hands.

Yamada treats the sense ‘record, chronicle’ as loan usage, but alternatively it may be extended usage on the basis of the thread of continuity in an account or record. As Qiu notes – with reference to Chinese – there is some overlap in usage of 紀 and 記 115 ‘account, record’, and this may also be the case in Japanese.

Examples:
  • 国旗 [KOKKI] - national flag

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 353 (‘flagpole and streaming banner’) ‘flag’, and 其 269 (originally ‘winnowing basket’, later other senses including ‘that’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘gather together’, to give ‘flag for troops to gather under’. KJ1970:240; YK1976:117; OT1968:457. Suggest 方 223 as ‘side’, and as 41 ‘person’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words, speech’, and 義 674 (originally denoted a beautiful dance or appearance, now meaning ‘righteousness’, qv) as phonetic with associated sense ‘criticize’ (Katō, Yamada, Shirakawa) or as semantic element meaning ‘correct’ (Ogawa; a meaning already found at the OBI stage, according to Schuessler). Either way, ‘discuss’ is the result of a generalized shift in meaning. KJ1970:240-41; YK1976:120; SS1984:165; OT1968:944; AS2007:566.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread’ (originally silk thread), and 合 134 (‘join’) as semantic and phonetic, to give ‘join up silk threads’. This involved quickly joining up broken silk threads from cocoons in the silk manufacturing process, and so ‘supplement, make up (a deficiency)’ evolved as an extended use. In modern Japanese, also employed occasionally for the verbal suffix – tamau , based on the older honorific verb tamau ‘to bestow’ (of a superior to an inferior).

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The underlying word seems to have been represented in writing already in Shang times, as there is an OBI form comprising 力 78 ‘strength’ tripled listed by Mizukami, meaning ‘collect strength and put together’. The graph 十 35 ‘ten, many’ was added at seal stage to reinforce the meaning, with a phonetic role with associated meaning ‘collect’ (Katō). MS1995:v1:168-9,138-9; KJ1970:360; YK1976:132.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and NJK 竟 (‘end’, originally of a piece of music) as phonetic with associated sense ‘appearance, shape’. In early China, mirrors were typically thin discs made of bronze, with the back decorated – often ornately – with patterns and motifs of great significance (mythological, etc.), and often featured inscriptions also. Bronze was a material used extensively for ritual artefacts such as mirrors, affordable only to the wealthy. KJ1970:350-51; OT1968:1049; YK1976:135. Suggest taking 竟 as its components 音 6 ‘sound’ and 儿 41 ‘bent legs’, for a Zen-like mnemonic.

  • 消極 [SHŌKYOKU] - cathode

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree/wood’ and CO 亟 (‘urge on, hurry’) as phonetic, typically taken as having associated sense ‘in the highest place’, thus timber in the highest place in a building, i.e. ‘ridgebeam’; by extension, ‘extremity, limit’ (Katō, Ogawa, Yamada). Shirakawa, by contrast, believes the initial meaning of 極 was a form of capital punishment (later written 殛 ), and that ridgebeam is a later meaning. KJ1970:284-5; YK1976:138; OT1968:515; SS1984:206; MS1995:v1:32-3. Awkward mnemonically but we suggest as two lines/bars 二 , with 口 22 ‘mouth/opening’, and hook, and 2003 ‘hand’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words’, and 川 50 (‘river’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘follow’, to give ‘make to follow using words, instruct’. Also has the specific meaning ‘native Japanese reading for a Chinese character’, or ‘ kun reading’. The graph also retains its early meaning ‘instruct’, reflecting the fact that when Chinese script and language were brought to Japan, the Japanese were instructed in the meanings of Chinese characters. KJ1970:344; MS1995:v2:1186-7; YK1976:144; OT1968:921.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 阝 376 (as abbreviated right-hand form of 邑 ‘settlement, village’), and 君 285 (‘lord’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘collect, accumulate’, to give ‘a collection of settlements’. This served as an administrative unit for such (of varying scale) from an early period in China, and then in Japan, where it is still used. KJ1970:343; YK1976:145; OT1968:1020.

  • 捷径 [SHŌKEI] - short cut

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 徑 . Late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 彳 131 ‘road, go’, and 巠 287 (thread stretched on a loom) as phonetic with associated sense ‘straight’ (Tōdō, Shirakawa, Ogawa). Thus ‘direct path’. However, Katō and Yamada take 巠 as ‘small’. This is just one of many examples of divergence in assessing the associated sense of a phonetic in the same graph – in this case, it seems to result from two different interpretations of the same explanation for 巠 in Zilin , a Chinese dictionary compiled ca. 300AD which has survived only in fragments. TA1965:498-9; SS1984:227-8; OT1968:347; KJ1970:345-6; YK1976:147. Take modern right-hand elements as 又 2003 ‘hand’ and 土 64 ‘ground’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 日 66 ‘sun’, and 京 110 (‘capital’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘light’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘demarcate’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). The latter sense derives from the clear boundary or line of demarcation between light and the shadow cast by an object; in Tōdō’s word-family ‘firm/clearly demarcate’, together with 境 680 ‘boundary’. KJ1970:83; YK1976:150; OT1968:470; TA1965:394-6.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 吉 1196 (‘good fortune’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘fasten tightly’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Either interpretation gives ‘tie knot in thread/rope’, and then by extension the more generalized ‘join up’; ‘conclude, tie up’ is a further, figurative extension. KJ1970:230; YK1976:154; TA1965:784-7; OT1968:777. We suggest 士 521 ‘samurai’ and 口 22 ‘mouth’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form 驗 . Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, and 僉 (CO, ‘people agree on opinion’). The associated meaning of 僉 here is disputed: one analysis takes it as phonetic with associated sense unclear (Katō, Yamada), regarding ‘examine’ as a loan usage. Tōdō, though, includes it in a word-family with associated sense ‘collect and bring together/under control’, an interpretation giving ‘examine’. KJ1970:376-7; YK1976:161; TA1965:842-6.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 囗 84 ‘enclosure’ (taken here as walls of a castle or citadel), and 古 121 (‘old’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘solid, hard, firm’, to give ‘defend solidly with castle walls’ or ‘defend castle walls solidly’. The meaning later became generalized to ‘hard, solid’; in Tōdō’s word-family ‘hard, solid’. KJ1970:392; YK1976:167; TA1965:385-90; OT1968:205.

Examples:
  • 気候 [KIKŌ] - climate
  • 候補 [KŌHO] - candidacy
  • 候文 [sōrōBUN] - historical style

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. Katō and Yamada treat as 亻 41 ‘person’, and 矦 (an NJK graph which they alone take as meaning ‘hunch-back’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘go/come out to greet’, and by extension ‘look out for’ (Katō, Yamada). Shirakawa also links 矦 to ‘target’, but regards it as referring to a purificatory ritual involving shooting arrows. Treatment by scholars reflects a degree of historical confusion between 候 and 侯 , two graphs similar in shape, pronunciation, and meaning. Uncertainty over the early history of the words and meanings represented by these two graphs is noted by Schuessler. As for the meaning ‘serve’ (primarily as an older meaning), Shirakawa observes on the basis of information in Yupian that in higher circles in early China there was a position designated as 候人 , a role which involved greeting visitors. The meanings ‘weather’ and ‘sign’ for 候 can be seen as extended senses deriving from ‘look out for’ relating to weather conditions. In ancient China the year was divided into the ‘seventy-two short periods’ ( 七十 二候 ), of five days each. Numerical categories such as this – other examples include the Five Elements ( 五行 ), the Eight [Musical] Sounds ( 八音 ), and the Ten Moral Obligations ( 十義 ) to name but a few – have been an integral part of Chinese culture from ancient times. KJ1970:398; YK1976:181; SS1984:300,296; AS2007:279. Suggest taking short vertical line as pointer. See too 侯 1326.

Etymology: Seal ; late, post- Shuowen graph. Has 舟 1450 ‘boat’, and 亢 (NJK, originally ‘[upright] neck’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘side’. Denotes several boats lashed together side-by-side for stability, or boat(s) crossing a river, or both these meanings together; sense later broadened to ‘navigate’ in general. KJ1970:160-62; YK1976:182; OT1968:837. Suggest taking 亢 as ‘top’ and as 845 ‘desk’.

  • 最新 [SAISHIN] - most recent

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 冃 ‘helmet, head covering’, and 取 317 as semantic and phonetic with meaning ‘take’, to give ‘seize unlawfully’. The meaning ‘most’ should be regarded as a loan usage. The top element 日 in the block script version of this graph – easily mistaken for 日 66 ‘sun, day’ – is just the result of historical shape regularization, a process which has often led, as here, to the etymology being obscured. KJ1970:501-2; YK1976:199; OT1968:157. We suggest taking 日 as ‘sun’ for convenience.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 才 139 (original meaning uncertain) as phonetic with associated sense ‘use’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘cut off/down; interrupt’ (Tōdō), to give ‘wood which is useful’ or ‘wood to cut’. Later, it also acquired generalized meaning ‘useful material, resource’ in both physical and figurative senses. KJ1970:422; YK1976:201; TA1965:107-9. Suggest taking 才 for its meaning ‘age’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 日 66 ‘day’, and 乍 141 (‘cut up wood; make’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate’, to give original sense ‘some days earlier’. The more restricted meaning ‘last, previous’ (in Japanese, effectively the only modern sense) dates back to at least the time of the Guangyun dictionary (1008 AD); in that work, 昨 is connected to 隔 1120 (‘separate’), but other proposed connections include 昔 346 ‘in the past; yesterday’ (Schuessler).

  • 札入れ [SATSUire] - billfold

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘wood’, and 乙 1072 (‘knife tool for carving’), usually taken as phonetic only, with associated meaning ‘shave off, reduce’, but may also be regarded as semantic. Thus ‘thinly shaved piece of wood’, i.e. a wooden tag. In modern usage, has a range of meanings such as ‘receipt, coupon, [paper currency] note’. Tags or thin tablets made of wood were in common use in early Japan – when paper was an expensive writing medium – as labels attached to goods, for letters and other documents, and for writing practice. Though typically quite short, they are a valuable source of information regarding aspects of early Japanese history. KJ1970:439; OT1968:486.

Examples:
  • 印刷 [INSATSU] - printing
  • 刷新 [SASSHIN] - reform
  • 校正刷り [KŌSEIzuri] - printer’s proofs

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 刂 198 ‘knife/cut’, and (listed in Kangxi zidian as an old way of writing 豕 89 ‘wild boar, pig’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘scrape, shave off’, to give ‘scrape with knife’ (Katō, Yamada). Katō also links 刷 to 削 1385 ‘scrape, pare, cut’, while Schuessler considers it to be probably related to NJK 刮 ‘scrape’, which comprises 刂 198 ‘knife’, with 舌 755 (‘tongue’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘create space’, giving original meaning ‘scraping tool’. Tōdō and Ogawa, alternatively, take the associated sense as ‘rub’, which is the meaning of another graph of similar shape, i.e. , which has 又 2003 ‘hand’ as determinative and originally referred to wiping one’s bottom (Katō). It is generally considered that printing – on wooden blocks – was invented in China; the earliest surviving printed book dates from 868AD, though earlier shorter printed texts or images do exist. Rubbing was part of the process of printing texts on wooden blocks, but it was a lesser task: the more demanding main work involved the actual engraving, i.e. the cutting out of text and/or images on the blocks, in reverse; a sheet of paper was then applied to the surface of the inked block and rubbed to produce the text or image. The earliest printing technology dates from later than the emergence of seal script, so it would be wrong to connect the etymological origins of 刷 to considerations of printing. Nevertheless, use of the ‘knife’ determinative is supportive of interpretation of 刷 as ‘scrape’ rather than ‘rub, wipe’, as Katō points out. ZY2009:v1:254; KJ1970:439; YK1976:204; TA1965:572-3,624-9; OT1968:115; AS2007:474,264; KJ1985:69. Regarding a mnemonic we suggest taking 巾 as itself, namely 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, and the NJK 256 尸 , the so-called ‘corpse’determinative, which often refers to a slumped figure with buttocks stuck out, and occurs with a meaning of ‘buttocks’ in a number of characters, such as 尾 1888 ‘tail’.

  • 観察 [KANSATSU] - observation

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). There are diverse interpretations for this graph, and the etymology is uncertain. There is general agreement regarding 宀 30 ‘roof’ as ‘cover’, though Katō appears to believe that a cover is specifically being put on a roof. As for 祭 299 ‘worship; festival’ (originally meat [and in some cases wine] being placed on an offering table/altar), Katō and Yamada treat this as a phonetic component with an associated sense ‘place on top’, to give the overall meaning ‘cover’. Yamada regards the meanings ‘look carefully, examine’ as loan usage. Katō too is of the same opinion. Shirakawa, for his part, takes 祭 as having a semantic role, with its original meaning, to give the proposed overall meaning of ‘make offerings in a shrine’ – presumably under a roof. Tōdō, by contrast, proposes the associated sense ‘cleanse and examine’, on the basis of classical usage. KJ1970:426; YK1976:205; SS1984:349; KJ1985:172. As a mnemonic, we suggest taking 宀 as a roof, and 祭 as ‘worship’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water, river’, and 台 (CO ‘I, my’; also corresponds to abbreviated form of 臺 ‘stand, platform’ 台 183) as phonetic with associated sense unknown (Katō, Yamada, Ogawa). It originally stood for the name of a river, as noted in Shuowen . Tōdō, however, includes 治 in a word-family ‘modify by human activity’, and gives a classical reference to show it was used at an early period meaning ‘modify (topography/landscape)’, and so by extension ‘regulate, govern’. Schuessler also notes early (but post-OBI) meanings which include ‘govern; punish; in good order’. KJ1970:15; YK1976:356; OT1968:566; TA1965:74-7; AS2007:619.

Examples:
  • 失敗 [SHIPPAI] - failure
  • 失敬 [SHIKKEI] - rudeness
  • 失業 [SHITSUGYŌ] - unemployment

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations differ, but only in a minor way. One analysis takes the graph as 手 34 ‘hand’, with 乙 1072 (knife tool for carving) as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘drop’, ‘lose’, to give ‘lose out of the hand’ (Katō, Yamada). This by extension came to mean ‘lose something in general’. Alternatively, the bottom right-hand element in the seal form has been taken as indicating movement sideways, but again with much the same overall meaning as the analysis noted above (Tōdō). KJ1970:486-7; YK1976:235; TA1965:754-6. We suggest taking the modern graph as 夫 601 ‘husband / man’ with the extra stroke taken as a baton.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph, in amended edition of Shuowen entitled Shuowen xinfu (Shuowen with New Appendices) . Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with 昔 346 (‘past, accumulated days’). One analysis takes 昔 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘accumulate’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or alternatively as phonetic with associated sense ‘person who pretends/is a substitute’, then generalized to ‘substitute; something not one’s own’, and so something borrowed. In Chinese this graph can also mean ‘lend’. KJ1970:615; YK1976:241; OT1968:70; TA1965:364-7; AS2007:314.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 禾 87 ‘grain’, and 重 326 (‘heavy’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘late’, giving ‘late ripening grain/crops’. Yamada sees ‘seed’ and ‘type, kind’ as loan usages, but Tōdō sees a semantic link between 重 ‘heavy’ and the heads of grain heavy with seed. KJ1970:704; YK1976:246; OT1968:736; TA1965:291.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree’, and 公 126 (‘public; fair’) as phonetic with associated sense regarding which interpretations differ. Katō takes as ‘needle’, to give tree with needle-shape leaves, while Ogawa takes as ‘gather, come together’, to give tree with leaves close together; both scholars come to the same meaning, i.e. pine tree. KJ1970:541-2; OT1968:493.

<b>笑</b>

Meaning: laugh, smile
Strokes: 10
Level: L3
Number: 537

Examples:
  • 苦笑 [KUSHŌ] - wry smile
  • 笑い声 [waraigoe] - laughter
  • 笑顔 [egao] - smiling face

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph which is included in Shuowen xinfu . This graph is the result of fluctuation in shape, or possibly error. According to Yamada, 笑 originated from a graph written 芺 , meaning ‘thistle’, which was borrowed as a loan writing for the abstract word meaning ‘laugh’; following this, as the result of miscopying, 芺 was written with 关 and then , and as a further variation the top element came to be written as 竹 / 58 ‘bamboo’. To disambiguate 芺 in the two senses of ‘thistle’ and ‘laugh’, 口 was added for the latter meaning, to give . As a further complicating twist, 口 22 (‘mouth’) was also added to 关 / above, to give 咲 1391 (note: 咲 is used in the sense ‘bloom’ only in Japanese; in Chinese it retains its original sense ‘laugh’). In broad terms, Ogawa adopts a broadly similar view, taking 芺 as being the result of miscopying, and borrowed as a loan for a word meaning ‘act coquettishly’; Katō treats the sense ‘act coquettishly’ as the original meaning of 笑 , and ‘laugh’ as a further extension of meaning. In the above there is reference to 竹 as a top element having been substituted for 艹 53 (‘grass, plant’); the explanation for this is that in the clerical script (the developmental stage before block script) these two elements were sometimes used interchangeably (as top elements), as noted by Qiu. YK1976:272; OT1968:748; KJ1970:85; QX2000:323. We suggest taking 夭 as a big man 大 56 with head bent.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 22 口 ‘mouth’ ‘speak’, and NJK 昌 (‘sun rises; rise’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘raise’, to give ‘raise the voice/pitch of the voice’, and by extension ‘sing’. The seal (and older) forms of 昌 point to only the upper component as being 日 66 ‘sun, day’, and the lower component as different: i.e. NJK 曰 ‘say, speak’ (determinative no. 73), with OBI and bronze forms representing breath coming out of the mouth when speaking.

  • 焼立て [yakitate] - fresh-baked

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 燒 . Has 火 8 ‘fire’ and CO 堯 (‘high’). Analysis of latter varies. One takes 堯 as associated sense ‘rise high’ (Katō, Yamada), giving ‘flames rise’. Ogawa sees it as associated sense ‘surround’ (later 繞 ), when setting wildfires in hunting. However, Tōdō feels phonetic role for 堯 unlikely based on historical pronunciation, and includes in his word-family ‘curve’, giving ‘flames curving upwards’. KJ1970:604-5; YK1976:275; OT1968:620; TA1965:245-6. We suggest taking as 十 [35] ‘ten’ x 3 and 一 [1] ‘one’ = 31 legs. See also 1230 暁 .

Examples:
  • 反省 [HANSEI] - (self-) reflection
  • 省略 [SHŌRYAKU] - omission
  • 厚生省 [KŌSEISHŌ] - Welfare Ministry

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); treated by Mizukami as having OBI and bronze equivalents (see below). Consists of 目 76 ‘eye’, with a second element 少 160 (‘few’) which is taken either as phonetic in function or as semantic, depending on the scholar. The phonetic view (Katō, Yamada) takes 少 as having the associated sense ‘cover, conceal’, and links 省 to what in seal script is the similarly-shaped 眚 , which means ‘cannot see clearly’ (a CO; in modern Chinese usage has meanings ‘cataract’ and ‘disaster’). Katō and Yamada feel that confusion arose between 眚 and 省 due partly to the similarity of shape, but also because of similarity in pronunciation between 省 and 視 889 ‘see’, which led to ‘see’ being taken (misunderstood) as the main sense of 省 ( 省 is noted as ‘see’ in Shuowen ). Ogawa also considers that 少 came to be used sometimes in place of 生 44 (‘life’) in this graph through error arising from the similarity in shape of these elements (there is limited similarity in shape between the two in some bronze forms). Tōdō treats the 少 of 省 as having a semantic function, and includes the graph and underlying word in a word-family ‘divide up small’; on this basis, he takes 省 as ‘make the eyes narrow and look’; ‘examine’ may then be seen as an extended sense, along with ‘ministry’, for in ancient China one had to pass examinations to work for the government.. Both the semantic and the phonetic interpretations are listed by Mizukami. 眚 (but not 省 ) is regarded by various commentators as having OBI and bronze equivalents, though Mizukami lists and treats both these graphs as occurring at the OBI and bronze stages with the same or ‘shared’ shapes, with divergence first occurring at the seal stage. Yamada suggests this divergence in shape between the two arose due to an old or regional variant being adopted as the basis for 省. Whichever analysis is followed, the sense ‘omit’ may be regarded as a loan usage. KJ1970:598-9; YK1976:270-71; OT1968:697; MS1995:v2:916-18,920-21; TA1965:481-2.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Traditional form has 兌 on right. Views vary. Has 言 118 ‘words, speech’, and NJK / 兌 (shaman – one who invokes and disseminates to the gods the will of humans) as either semantic or phonetic. Yamada and Shirakawa take semantically as ‘shaman who invokes the gods’; Katō, however, sees here as phonetic with associated sense ‘set up, establish’. Resultant overall meaning of 説 based on the above is ‘disseminate/set out ideas through language’. YK1976:313; SS1984:513; KJ1970:602-3. Suggest as ‘elder brother’ 兄 114 with 八 ‘eight’ 70, often used to show dispersal, as here.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 戔 (‘two halberds; fight, injure’ – see 545) as phonetic with associated sense ‘few, little’, to give ‘little water’, and hence ‘shallow’. ‘Light (in color)’ is an extended sense. KJ1970:760-61; YK1976:316; OT1968:575; TA1965:569.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form ; Interpretations vary. Has 辶 / 辶 85 ‘go, walk’, and 巽 (CO, ‘arrange items on table in order’) as phonetic with associated sense taken by Katō and Yamada as ‘continue afterwards’ &gt; ‘continue walking’. Ogawa, alternatively, treats 巽 as both semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘arrange properly’, to give original meaning ‘select, arrange, and send’ for 選 . With Ogawa’s treatment, ‘choose’ is a selectively extended sense, while Katō and Yamada take it as a loan usage. KJ1970:625; YK1976:320; OT1968:1014. We suggest taking 己 as 866 ‘self’ in its original meaning of ‘twisting threads’ (x 2), with 共 484 ‘together’, plus 辶 movement.

  • 巣箱 [subako] - nesting box
  • 巣立つ [sudatsu] - leave nest/home

Etymology: Bronze ; seal ; traditional 巢 . Etymology disputed. One view takes as 木 73 ‘tree’, with top element representing a bird’s nest (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Seal form suggests this, but the one bronze form scholars list has an ordered appearance, suggesting an artificial object. Katō treats top element as pictograph of container – in this case wine strainer or press – but here acting as phonetic (corresponding to later 甾 ) and having associated sense ‘gather, collect’, to give ‘birds gather and settle on a tree’. As things are collected in a container, the top element may be taken as both semantic and phonetic if Katō is followed. OT1968:508; SS1984:542; KJ1970:432. Suggest take as 果 454 ‘fruit tree’ with three sticks on top.

<b>卒</b>

Level: L3
Number: 564

Examples:
  • 卒業 [SOTSUGYŌ] - graduation
  • 兵卒 [HEISOTSU] - soldier
  • 卒去 [SOKKYO] - death

Etymology: Seal . Seal has 衣 444 ‘garment’, with a mark 丿. Typically the mark is taken as showing a way of making the garment distinctive for use by a particular group, namely slaves or low-ranking servants, possibly by using dyes; the garment may have been a lightweight one to wear on top. In this view, overall meaning of 卒 is ‘dyed garment’ (Katō, Yamada), and senses such as ‘sudden’ and ‘die’ are loan usages. In contrast, Shirakawa attributes a ritualistic significance, considering ‘die’ to be the main meaning of this graph, based on it originally showing an upper garment for a dead person, with the element 丿 showing a cord for tying; a similar type of garment was later worn also by low-ranking servants and soldiers. In Shirakawa’s treatment, the sense ‘sudden’ appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:651-2; YK1976:338; OT1968:139; MS1995:v1:168-9; SS1984:556. Suggest take 十 as ‘ten’ 35, 人人 as ‘men, persons’ (see 41), and 亠 as ‘top hat’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, and a top element showing a waistband with various items attached, to give ‘belt/sash to wear round the waist with items attached’. The curved middle element in the seal form ( 冖 in block script) normally means ‘cover’, but in this graph probably indicates ‘wear around the waist’. KJ1970:664; YK1976:344-5; OT1968:317. Suggest taking as 山 26 ‘mountain’ and—as ‘zone’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses vary. Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and disputed element 氐 (interpreted as either ‘base of small hill’, or ‘spoon touching bottom of plate’ &gt; ‘down low’, ‘scrape’) as semantic and phonetic (see 氏 522 ‘clan’). Former view (Katō, Yamada) gives ‘those who live lower down, servants’, as opposed to the nobility; adherents of the other view (Ogawa, Tōdō) take 低 to mean ‘short person’. In both cases, ‘short, low’ is an extended sense generalized from original meaning. Mizukami lists both views for the element 氐 . KJ1970:713-4; YK1976:372; TA1965:749-52; OT1968:55; MS1995:v2:724-6. Suggest taking 氏 as ‘clan’ with bottom line beneath, and 亻 41 as ‘persons, people’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 广 127 ‘house, building’, and 氐 (either ‘base of small hill’, or ‘spoon touching bottom of plate’ &gt; ‘down low’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘dwelling at foot of hill’ (see 575). Yamada takes ‘lowest part, bottom’ as loan usage, but it can alternatively be seen as extended sense through generalization. Ogawa takes 氐 differently, as phonetic only with associated sense ‘stop, stay’; in this view, ‘bottom’ is loan use. KJ1970:713; YK1976:373; OT1968:327-8. As 575, use ‘clan’ 氏 and ‘bottom line’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form has 日 66 ‘sun’, and 勺 (‘ladle; traditional unit of measure’, in Jōyō kanji List 1981, excluded 2010) as phonetic with associated sense ‘white, bright’, to give ‘bright sunlight’. Block script has this graph with 白 69 ‘white’, not 日 , and 的 is treated in Kangxi zidian as a later variant form of 旳 ; the meaning range ‘white, bright’ for 白 may have led to this change between seal and block script. Katō and Yamada suggest the meaning ‘target’ derives from targets having been white. Meanings such as ‘-like’ (to form adjectives) and – in Chinese – for other grammatical elements represent loan usage. KJ1970:720; YK1976:375; OT1968:687; AS2007:631.

Originally, thought to have normally denoted a site with earth piled up high with a building set on top; appears to have come to denote a very substantial building.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 牜 108 ‘ox, cow’, and 寺 149 (‘temple’) as phonetic. The phonetic is taken as associated sense ‘single young male’, to give ‘bull’ (Katō, Yamada), or alternatively ‘stand upright’, to give ‘stud bull’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Bulls were often taken for sacrificial purposes, and the ones selected tended to be of the highest quality, hence the sense ‘special’; Shirakawa also quotes an early passage in which 特 has the meaning ‘special’, this time with reference to people. KJ1970:481-2; YK1976:394; TA1965:88-90; SS1984:659.

Etymology: Seal . Has 火 / 灬 8 ‘flames, fire’, and (later 埶 ) (‘kneel on the ground and plant tree’: see 495). The latter element is taken in one analysis as phonetic with associated sense ‘rising heat from fermenting wine’, later generalized in meaning to ‘hot vapor/hot’ and combining with 火 / 灬 to give ‘heat; burn’. Another interpretation takes 埶 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘power, energy’, regarding it as the original way of writing 勢 747 ‘power’, giving ‘heat to burn things’ (Ogawa). KJ1970:354-5; YK1976:402-3; OT1968:626. We suggest taking top left element as ‘mounds of earth’ (see 627), and 丸 101 as ‘circle/round’.

Level: L1

Examples:
  • 票決 [HYŌKETSU] - vote
  • 投票 [TŌHYŌ] - voting
  • 伝票 [DENPYŌ] - chit, slip

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). As the seal form shows, originally has 火 8 ‘flames, fire’, and upper element as phonetic with associated sense ‘fly, fly up’, to give ‘sparks fly up’. Shirakawa agrees with latter meaning, but links graph to the ritual burning of a corpse (cremation). Tōdō includes 票 – together with 標 599 – in his word-family ‘rise lightly’. The modern senses ‘vote’, ‘sign’, ‘ticket’ seem to be loan usages. KJ1970:845-6; YK1976:428; OT1968:723; SS1984:725-6; TA1965:275-7. Take as 西 169 ‘west’ plus 示 723 ‘show’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 票 598 qv as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘topmost tree branches; twigs’, to give ‘slender treetop branches, tips of treetops’ (Katō, Yamada, Ogawa). Yamada takes ‘sign, mark’ as a loan usage, but Tōdō treats as an extended use, meaning a signboard placed high up, as does Shirakawa. KJ1970:846-7; YK1976:428-9; OT1968:524; TA1965:275-7; SS1984:727. As in 598, we suggest taking as 西 169 ‘west’ plus 示 723 ‘show’, not forgetting 木 ‘tree’.

Examples:

  • 京都府 [KYŌTO-FU] - Kyōto Pref.

Etymology: Seal . Has 广 127 ’roof, building’, and 付 602 (‘attach’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘collect, gather’, to give ‘building where things are gathered together’, meaning a storehouse. Later, this took on the more restricted sense of a building to store documents and the like, and so ‘government office’. By further extension, came to mean an administrative area under government control such as an urban prefecture or the seat of government. KJ1970:823; MS1995:v1:452-3; YK1976:432-3; OT1968:328.

Etymology: Seal . Has 刂 198 ‘knife’, and 畐 (CO, ‘wide-necked jar’, see 409) as phonetic with associated sense ‘open up’, to give ‘open up with a knife’, such as sacrificial animal. ‘Divide in two’ evolved as an extended sense, and by Han times one of the two divided parts, referred to as 副 , had acquired the meaning ‘secondary’, hence sense range ‘deputy, vice-, sub’. Mizukami lists one OBI form that he equates with 副. MS1995:v1:134-5; KJ1970:828; YK1976:437. Suggest take as 一 1 ‘single’, 口 22 ‘entrance’, and 田 63 ‘field’.

KJ1970:256; YK1976:440; TA1965:730; OT1968:761.

Strokes: 7

Number: 607

Examples:
  • 別名 [BETSUMEI] - alias
  • 特別 [TOKUBETSU] - special
  • 別れ [wakare] - parting

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 刂 198 ‘knife’, with 冎 . The latter element is interpreted variously as ‘skull, cranium’ (Yamada), or as a pictograph of where the base of the skull and the top vertebra meet (occipital bone) (Mizukami), or as ‘bone (in general)’ (Ogawa), to give ‘separate meat from skull/bone with a knife’, with this leading to the extended general meaning of ‘separate’. It was also used in early Chinese for a near-homophone meaning ‘to be different’, and thus ‘special’ may be regarded as a loan usage. The left-hand side of 別 , which is noticeably different in shape in block script from the seal form of 冎 , appears to result from cursivized equivalents found in the clerical script. Mizukami lists one OBI form which he treats as 別. KJ1970:848; YK1976:445; OT1968:114; MS1995:v1:108-9, 130-31; AS2007:167; SK1984:94. This is a difficult graph in terms of mnemonics, but we suggest taking the left part as an 口 22 ‘opening’ with as ‘special’ variant of 力 78 ‘strength’.

Level: L3
Number: 609

Examples:
  • 変成 [HENSEI] - metamorphosis
  • 大変 [TAIHEN] - very
  • 変わり者 [kawarimono] - eccentric

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 變. Has 攵 ( 攴 ) 112 ‘strike’, and (CO, original meaning: ‘thread becomes tangled’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘knock over and turn into something different’. Subsequently the sense ‘strike/knock over’ was omitted, to give the generalized meaning ‘change’. ‘Strange’ may be seen as an extended sense. Mizukami lists a few bronze forms which he takes as equivalents of 變 . In the modern abbreviated shape 変 , bottom element is 攵 in a variant 3-stroke shape (which is not 夂 ‘descending foot’: det. 34). KJ1970:898; YK1976:446-7; MS1995:v2:1214-5; OT1968:444. Suggest taking upper part as variant of 赤 48 ‘red’ (i.e. sort of red) and, though incorrect etymologically, 夂 as cross-legs.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 更 1323 (‘change’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘servant; use a servant’, and by extension ‘convenient, comfortable; service, mail’. The meaning ‘bodily waste’ appears to be a further euphemistic extension (cf. British English ‘public convenience’ in the sense ‘public toilet or restroom’). OT1968:66; YK1976:448-9.

Etymology: Seal . Scholarly opinion is divided over whether OBI forms for this graph exist, and whether there were originally separate graphs for 末 and the similarly-shaped 未 617 (qv, originally, ‘tree with luxuriant growth’). There is general agreement that the graph 末 shows branches growing out from a tree (though Tōdō takes it to signify small branches at the top of a tree and equivalent originally to 未 ), but while Mizukami and Ma do not recognize any OBI forms, Katō and Yamada list what they take to be OBI forms for 末 , and consider that originally, at least, there was no difference in shape between 末 and 未 . The upper horizontal stroke of 末 is taken to focus attention on the top part of the tree, signifying ‘tip, end’ in a physical sense and by extension the abstract sense also, i.e. ‘end; last, final’. MS1995:v1:644-5; KJ1970:868; YK1976:462-3; QX2000:183; AS2007:389; TA1965:667-70.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 滿 ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’ and / (originally meant ‘join two halves of a gourd’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘fill right up’, to give ‘fill container till water overflows’, then by extension ‘full’. KJ1970:202; OT1968:597; YK1976:463. We suggest as 艹 53 ‘grass’ and 両 434 ‘both’ (qv, also involving a gourd).

Etymology: Seal forms , ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The first seal form has 血 288 ‘blood’, and meaning ‘tributary’ (see also 派 965) as semantic and phonetic; the second has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, with . Both forms give the meaning ‘vein’, but the second came to predominate, probably because it was the one given in Shuowen , and is the main form given for this graph in the authoritative Kangxi zidian , which lists a third form, 脉 ( 月 ‘flesh, meat’, with 永 644 ‘long’), as a variant of 脈 . Extended usage is seen, for instance in ‘coal vein’, and in the sense ‘pulse’. KJ1970:751; YK1976:465; OT1968:822. We suggest taking as a variant of 川 50 ‘river, flow’, but with the specific meaning of ‘tributary’, and 月 as ‘flesh’.

  • 無くなる [nakunaru] - disappear, go

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Originally, in OBI and some bronze forms, this graph had the same shape as what later became 舞 1920 (person with long decorative sleeves, shown with feet pointed away from each other; ‘dance’). Taken to depict a person dancing with what appear to be long decorative sleeves, or what Qiu identifies as oxtails or similar hanging down. While Qiu’s suggestion might seem bizarre initially, he does note a passage in the Spring and Autumn Annals (compiled ca. 239BC) which describes dancing while holding oxtails. This graph, which originally had the sense ‘dancing’, was borrowed to conveniently represent another word of similar pronunciation meaning ‘not have’. In some bronze forms (and consistently later), we find 舛 (feet pointing different ways 336) added to further clarify the sense ‘dance’, while a different element (corresponding to modern 亡 985, now meaning ‘die’ or disappear’ but originally showing someone hiding in a corner and meaning: ‘cannot be seen’) was added to the predecessor of 無 at the seal stage. Shapes close to 無 itself, which is somewhat simpler than the seal equivalent, were already well-established in the clerical script. QX2000:186-7; YK1976:466-7; OT1968:621; AS2007:518; SK1984:467-8. We suggest taking the lower part as 灬 8 ‘fire’ and the upper part as a bound wheat-sheaf.

Examples:
  • 約束 [YAKUSOKU] - promise

  • 約十人 [YAKUJŪNIN] - ca. 10 people

Etymology: Seal . This graph has 糸 29 ‘thread, cord’, and 勺 . The latter was formerly in the Jōyō kanji List, but was one of the five characters to be withdrawn from it in the changes in 2010. It originally depicted wine or soup being ladled into a container such as a half-gourd, but here it acts as a phonetic with associated meaning ‘bind, fasten’, to give ‘fasten tightly with cord (in some cases leaving noticeable marks)’. By extension, it acquired meanings such as ‘reduce, contract, bring together’, and then abstract meanings such as ‘make agreement’ and ‘summarise’. (One notes the similar use of the figurative concept/term ‘binding’ in English with regard to agreements and promises.) The latter sense of ‘summarise’ involves removal of non-essential points or items, thereby perhaps generating the meaning ‘approximately’. Early (post-OBI) senses listed by Schuessler include ‘abbreviate, condense, essential’. OT1968:768; MS1995:v2:1004,v1:146-7; KJ1970:874; YK1976:475.

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Some bronze forms (as here) have 女 37 ‘woman’ as lower element; analyses of upper part differ. Seal form is taken as backbone with hipbones on either side (Katō, Yamada), or as two hands enclosing waist (Ogawa), or as hipbones and pelvis (Shirakawa), or yet again as 襾 (‘stopper, plug’) (not 西 169 ‘west’), as abbreviated form of 票 598 (‘sign’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘light’ or ‘tighten’ (Mizukami). Lower part of seal form has not 女 but a shape to represent two legs. Despite varied analysis, consensus is that the graph’s meaning is ‘waist’ (later written 腰 2054); by extension, ‘tie a waistband’ or ‘central part’, hence ‘pivotal, vital’. KJ1970:87; YK1976:483; OT1968:912; SS1984:847; MS1995:v2:1174-5. To simplify, we suggest as west(ern), and lower part as woman.

Both analyses refer to spokes of a cart/chariot wheel, extended to wheel itself. KJ1970:911-12; YK1976:500; OT1968:986; TA1965:686-9. We suggest 侖 as ‘capped’ ‘wheels’ 冊 .

Usually taken as 犬 19 ‘dog’, with 卥 (CO, originally, ‘foolish head’; by extension ‘difficult to distinguish’, then ‘similar, look alike’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘raccoon’, to give original meaning ‘raccoon-like creature’ (Katō, Yamada). The senses ‘similar; variety, sort’ are loan usages. Shirakawa, by contrast, seeks to give a ritualistic interpretation to the origin of the graph 類 , arguing that rice ( 米 220) and dogs ( 犬 ) were offered to the gods. KJ1970:914; YK1976:501; MS1995:1444-5; SS1984:895. Suggest taking 頁 103 ‘head’, 米 220 ‘rice’, and 大 56 ‘big’.

Has ice 冫 401, and 令 633 (‘rule’) as phonetic, but associated sense disputed. 令 is taken either as i] ‘shiver’ (Katō, Yamada), or as ii] ‘clear’ (Ogawa, Tōdō); i] gives ‘coldness of ice to make a person shiver’, while ii] gives ‘clear/bright cold’ or ‘ice which is clear/transparent’. KJ1970:915; YK1976:502; OT1968:915; TA1965:475-7.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 列 437 (‘line’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘lined up’, to give ‘people lined up’. Lining up involves a degree of organization and arrangement, and this appears to have given rise to extended senses such as ‘usage/precedent’ and ‘example/likening’. KJ1970:922; YK1976:502; OT1968:62.

Etymology: OBI ; seal ; traditional 歷. OBI has 止 143 ‘footprint’ (Mizukami and Ogawa take as ‘walk’), and 秝 (CO, orig two grain stalks) giving ‘place (seedlings) at set intervals’. Seal form also has 止 , but with 厤 (a CO, 厂 abbrev. of 石 47 ‘stone’, with 秝 as phonetic with sense ‘grind, polish’, giving ‘grind with whetstone’, or ‘polish and put in order’) as phonetic, again meaning ‘lined up at intervals’. Overall meaning is ‘walk/move at set intervals’, esp. of heavenly bodies (for movement of sun, a separate graph 曆 [2112 ‘calendar’] was devised at seal stage). By the Western Zhou period (11 th century – 771 BC) the graph 歷 was used to mean ‘series’; extending to ‘history; path’. Suggest 厂 as cliff, 止 in usual meaning of ‘stop’, and 林 as ‘forest’ 79. MS1995:v1:706-7,186-7; KJ1970:921; OT1968:540; YK1976:503.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. One is 車 33 ‘vehicle’, and 辶 85 ‘go’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘vehicle moves (slowly)’ (Katō, Yamada); this may refer to multiple vehicles together. However, Ogawa takes 辶 with 車 as abbrev of 輦 (CO) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘men pull a vehicle’. Tōdō includes 連 in his word-family ‘be linked up’, and sees it as denoting vehicles moving together. ‘Be linked together (in a row)’ is an extended meaning. KJ1970:924-6; YK1976:504; OT1968:1002; TA1965:552-4.

Examples:
  • 労働者 [RŌDŌSHA] - laborer
  • 苦労 [KURŌ] - hardship
  • 過労 [KARŌ] - overwork

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 勞 . Perhaps most convincingly taken as 力 78 ‘strength, effort’ and as an abbreviation of 螢 (NJK, ‘firefly’) with semantic and phonetic function, meaning ‘small flame’, to give ‘work by the light of small flames’, i.e. ‘night work’ (Katō, Yamada), this then being extended to ‘work’ in general. Shirakawa, alternatively, looks to a ritualistic interpretation, linking it to sacred flames used to purify agricultural implements at the beginning and end of the season. Mizukami lists a number of bronze forms which he equates to 労 . KJ1970:81; YK1976:506; SS1984:913; MS1995:v1:142-3. As a mnemonic we suggest taking the three short strokes on top of roof 冖 as an ornate roof (see also 学 11), and 力 as ‘effort’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 錄 . Has 金 16 ‘metal’ (in ancient China, typically referred to bronze or copper), and 彔 (CO, originally a pictograph showing liquid [probably wine] being strained and dripping down) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘ooze, soak through’; overall meaning is that which exudes from copper, i.e. ‘verdigris’ (Katō, Yamada). Ogawa takes 彔 as phonetic with associated sense ‘shine’, to give ‘shine with a metal color’. Either way, the sense ‘record’ is just a loan usage, but the verdigris interpretation is more compelling (see 緑 435 ‘green’ also). KJ1970:931-2; YK1976:507; OT1968:1046. As a mnemonic we suggest associating this graph with ‘green’, as they have the same right hand part in the modern form.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 壓 . The graph comprises 土 64 ‘earth, soil’, and 厭 (CO, analyzed as ‘cover’, ‘oppress’, ‘press’, or ‘sated with oppressive feeling [from overeating]’, ‘weary’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘press down’, to give ‘press down and cover with earth’; later this became more generalized in meaning as ‘press down, pressure’. The element 土 was added at the seal stage to create this graph so as to differentiate clearly the meaning ‘press down’ from other meanings of 厭 . KJ1970:105; YK1976:50; OT1968:210; MS1995:v1:186-9, v2:840-41; TA1965:853-9; AS2007:550; QX2000:267. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 厂 as a cliff.

Strokes: 11

Examples:
  • 移動 [IDŌ] - movement

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The graph comprises 禾 87 ‘grain’, and 多 180 (‘many, numerous’) as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘sway (in the breeze)’, to give the original meaning ‘grain plants swaying in the breeze’. Commentators generally regard ‘move’ as a loan usage, but the original sense of 移 already involves some degree of movement. On the basis of the early Chinese sound values, it seems likely that 多 is serving here as an abbreviation for 迻 (CO, ‘walk with a swaying motion’). ‘Transfer’ is an extended meaning. KJ1970:17-18; YK1976:55; OT1968:733; MS1995:v2:1286; AS2007:566.

Number: 645

Examples:
  • 経営 [KEIEI] - management
  • 営業 [EIGYŌ] - business
  • 営所 [EISHO] - barracks

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 營 . Analyses differ in relatively minor ways. One element is 呂 , in outward form corresponding to a NJK graph meaning ‘spine’ (in which two individual vertebrae are depicted, with the linking stroke first added only at the seal stage), but regarded as having a different sense here, i.e. ‘complex of linked buildings (or possibly rooms), palace’. This combines with the disputed upper element . Katō takes as the old form of 螢 (‘firefly’; modern 蛍 1263), here serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘surround’, to give ‘complex of buildings surrounded by fence/walls’. Yamada and Ogawa agree with this interpretation. Mizukami lists several alternative interpretations of what represents here, but still with the sense ‘surround’. ‘Barracks’ may be regarded as an extended sense. ‘Perform, conduct’ is treated as loan usage by Yamada; Schuessler notes ‘lay out, plan, build’ as early meanings. KJ1970:82, 79-80; YK1976:66; OT1968:187; MS1995:v2:812-3,v1:222; AS2007:576. As a mnemonic we suggest taking the upper element as an ornate roof (see also 学 11), and taking the linked squares as rooms within a bigger building. Alternatively, given the phonetic use of 呂 in the term 風呂 furo (bath) and consequent associations, a mnemonic could be based on the furo.

KJ1970:89-90; YK1976:68; OT1968:584; TA1965:336; AS2007:562.

  • 桜桃 [ŌTŌ] - cherry fruit

  • 桜肉 [sakuraNIKU] - horsemeat

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 櫻 ; late graph, first listed in 6th century Yupian . Has 木 73 ‘tree’, and element 嬰 (sense and function disputed). Mizukami and Katō analyze 嬰 as 女 37 ‘woman’, with 賏 (CO, ‘necklace’, from 貝 10 ‘shell’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘small, young’ (Mizukami takes ‘surround, add’ as loan usages), to give ‘baby girl’. Ogawa takes 嬰 as 女 with 賏 as both phonetic and semantic, giving ‘woman wearing necklace’, and by extension ‘surround’ (here ‘neck’), seeing ‘baby’ as loan usage. Both analyses have associated meaning ‘small’, significance being that in ancient China both peach and cherry were prized as fruits, and there are early references (noted by Katō) to cherry fruit being called ‘small peach’. Note: the graph 桜 and word sakura normally refer to flowering rather than fruiting cherry. KJ1970:83,3; MS1995:v1:346-7; OT1968:264,502; SS1984:65. Take top right as three petals.

  • 仮病 [KEBYŌ] - feigned illness

Etymology: Bronze ; seal ; traditional 假. Originally, this graph was written 叚 . Bronze form consists of i] two hands, with ii] an additional element 厂 (usually taken as ‘cliff’ or ‘cave dwelling’) with two short horizontal strokes or dots inside. There is some divergence in analysis. One element is often taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘false, deception; substitute’, to give the overall sense ‘wear a mask’ (Katō, Mizukami, Yamada, Ogawa). The basis for the inclusion of ‘mask’ here may not seem clear, but both Shirakawa and Tōdō also support this. Tōdō includes 叚 (and 假 ) in a word-family meaning ‘cover something underneath’, an interpretation which gives credible support for the sense ‘wear a mask’. Abstract meanings such as ‘imitation, provisional, temporary’ may be seen as extended senses. The element 亻 41 ‘person’ was added at the seal stage, with no significant change of meaning. The substitution of 反 for 叚 to create 仮 can be traced back to Han period cursivized clerical script forms. KJ1970:120; MS1995:v1:182-4,198-201; YK1976:79; OT1968:48; SS1984:71; TA1965:381-3; SK1984:62-3. We suggest taking 反 as the same-shaped 反 393 ‘oppose’.

The graph has 亻 41 ‘person’ and 賈 (NJK, itself comprising 襾 ‘stopper, cover’, and 貝 10 ‘shell currency, valuables’, meaning ‘store goods, trade’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘business of buying and selling’, to give ‘someone who buys and sells, merchant’. By extension, the graph acquired related or extended other meanings such as ‘price, worth’. KJ1970:116; YK1976:80; OT1968:58,911,957; SS1984:72. As a mnemonic we suggest taking the right-hand part of the modern graph as 西 169 ‘west’, with 亻 41 ‘person’.

Etymology: Seal . Has 辶 85 ‘walk, go’, and 咼 (originally, either ‘distorted mouth shape’ [Katō] or ‘smooth-moving body joints’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘many, much’, to give ‘go a long way/too far’ (Mizukami takes as ‘much latitude/margin’, to give ‘walk to a destination along an easy road’). OBI forms are listed by Mizukami, all of slightly different structure. KJ1970:312; YK1976:83; MS1995:v2:1298-1300; OT1968:1005.

Etymology: OBI ; seal . OBI has 牛 108 ‘ox, cow’, and element showing two hands round a third element – the pictographic stage of 角 97 ‘horn’. This is commonly taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘divide up, split’, giving ‘divide up an ox/cow’, then more generally ‘divide, take apart’. Ma, alternatively, takes 角 as semantic. It may be both semantic and phonetic. Seal form has different composition, with 刀 198 ‘knife’, to give ‘cut up’; already used in generalized sense at an early period, not necessarily ‘cut up an ox’. Schuessler treats ‘understand’ as a separate word related to that for ‘divide up’, rather than an extended sense. MS1995:v2:1182-3; MR2007:306; KJ1970:150; YK1976:92.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (post- Shuowen ). Has 石 47 ‘stone’, and 隺 (CO ‘fly high; high’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hard’, to give ‘hard stone’, later just ‘hard’ (Katō, Yamada, Ogawa). Shirakawa explains link between ‘fly high’ and ‘hard’ by 隺 showing a bird ( 隹 324) trying to fly higher but firmly confined, representing something ‘hard’. Tōdō sees the bird as a crane, the NJK graph for which is 鶴 ( 隺 , with 鳥 190 ‘bird’). SS1984:105,108; KJ1970:195-6; YK1976:97; OT1968:714; TA1965:265. Suggest as ‘strange’ roof.

Examples:
  • 金額 [KINGAKU] - sum of money

  • 額際 [hitaigiwa] - hairline

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 客 270 (‘visitor’) or alternatively 各 (‘each’ 462) – both having similar pronunciation at that time – as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘shave off the head hair’, to indicate that part of the face framed by the borders of the hair when shaved, i.e. ‘forehead’ (Katō, Yamada). Normally one would not associate shaving with the forehead, but in ancient China (and in various periods in Japanese history also), the hairline was shaved so as to move hair further up the forehead, and /or trimming it at the sides, leaving a ‘desirable/fashionable’ framing of the forehead. Alternatively there is an interpretation of the phonetic element as having an associated sense of ‘wide, broad’, to denote the broad part of the face, again giving the meaning ‘forehead’ (Ogawa). ‘Frame’ is an extended sense related to the borders of the hairline, and ‘plaque’ may represent a further extension, whereas ‘amount /sum’ appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:192; YK1976:98; OT1968:1106; AS2007:253,334.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 刂 ( 刀 ) 198 ‘knife, blade, cut, sword’, and 干 840 as phonetic with an associated sense of ‘dig out, carve out’ (Katō, Yamada), or ‘cut and make level’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). (Originally, 干 depicted a forked thrusting weapon with a hand-guard; but owing to its convenient simplicity it has over the centuries been borrowed extensively. Its modern meaning is ‘dry’.) The process of engraving woodblocks to produce texts and illustrated material on a large scale that was developed during the first millennium AD in China subsequently led to the meaning ‘print, publish’. YK1976:100; KJ1970:204; TA1965:601-06; OT1968:111; AS2007:331. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 干 in its current meaning of ‘dry’, with 刂 as ‘sword’.

The original form in Shuowen is 榦 , where the meaning is given as wooden posts standing firmly in the ground at each end when building a fence; the graph comprises 木 73 ‘tree’, with the element 倝 (disputed sense as phonetic here) in the variant form , which shows 人 41 ‘person’, in one of its modified shapes as 人 . 倝 (or the variant), which is often taken as originally meaning ‘sun rising up’ (Mizukami, Katō, Yamada), is taken by Katō and Yamada as a phonetic with associated sense ‘base, stem’, to give ‘trunk/stem (rising up)’; Shirakawa, by contrast, interprets as a flagpole topped with a good luck symbol and banner (Ogawa also says ‘flagpole’), and follows the Shuowen view in regarding two such flagpoles being used for fence-building. Qiu considers that the element 倝 in its variant form was poorly recognized as a phonetic, a point which no doubt led to substitution of 干 (modern meaning ‘dry’: see 840) as phonetic instead, creating 幹 originally as a popular variant of 榦 . Either interpretation of 倝 still leads to the basic sense ‘rising high’, which together with 木 gives ‘tree/pole rising high’, and hence ‘trunk, main part’. DJ2009:v2:469; KJ1970:102; MS1995:v1:70-71; YK1976:104; OT1968:324; ZY2009:v1:30,v2:526; QX2000:170. As a mnemonic we suggest taking as 日 66 ‘sun’ rising through ‘plants’ 艹 53.

<b>慣</b>
Reading: KAN,
Meaning: become
Strokes: 14
Level: L3
Number: 668

Examples:
  • 習慣 [SHŪKAN] - habit, custom
  • 慣例 [KANREI] - convention
  • 世慣れた [yonareta] - worldly-wise

Etymology: Seal form A ( 遦 ) ; seal form B ( 摜 ) ; 慣 itself is a late variant. 遦 (CO; has 辶 ’walk along road, go’ 85) and 摜 (CO; has 扌 ‘hand’ 34) are both defined in Shuowen as ‘familiar with’ or ‘custom’. In both graphs, the element 貫 (‘pierce’ 1148) is phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate’. For 遦 , Katō suggests original meaning ‘conduct by accumulating (actions)’, and for 摜 ‘become proficient using hands’. For 慣 , listed in Yupian (6th century), Yamada suggests taking as ‘become proficient by accumulating in the mind’. Not clear, though, whether these graph variations reflected actual meaning differences. KJ1970:337; YK1976:105; TA1965:640-42; DJ2009:v1:142,v3:986; AS2007:266. We suggest taking elements 貫 1148 ‘pierce’, 貝 10 ‘shell-money’, and 忄 164 ‘heart, mind’.

<b>眼</b>

Strokes: 11
Level: L1
Number: 669

Examples:
  • 双眼鏡 [SŌGANKYŌ] - binoculars
  • 肉眼 [NIKUGAN] - naked eye
  • 血眼 [chimanako] - bloodshot eyes

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. Most scholars take 目 76 ‘eye’, and 艮 281 (NJK ‘stop’, originally ‘hostility’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘round’, to give ‘eyeball’, and also ‘eye’ (Katō, Yamada); this view is supported by Schuessler, who sees the graph 眼 as representing an early Chinese (Late Han) word for ‘knob, bulge’, and a related near-homophone of that for ‘eyeball, eye’. Ogawa has a different view, taking 艮 as having associated sense ‘division’, to mean ‘eye cavity’ – presumably ‘eye socket’. Despite divergence in analysis, all scholars take 眼 as coming to mean ‘eye’ as a general term, like 目 76, though the two graphs are differentiated in modern written Japanese (and Chinese). KJ1970:215-6; YK1976:108-9; AS2007:555; OT1968:700. Take 艮 as variant ‘good’ 良 628.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 宀 30 ‘roof, dwelling’, and 奇 1174 (originally person standing on one leg; now ‘strange’) either as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘stand on one leg’ (Yamada), or as phonetic with associated sense ‘rely on’ (Katō, Ogawa). In either case, the overall meaning is taken to be ‘stay temporarily at someone else’s house’. In Tōdō’s word-family indicating ‘bent’ (‘be bent at ninety degrees’). YK1976:114; KJ1970:123; OT1968:280; TA1965:578-82.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

YK1976:115; KJ1970:237; AS2007:239-40.

Etymology: Seal . Has 人 41 ‘person’, and a stroke similar to 乀 typically taken to mean ‘hold back’, giving ‘stop, stand still’; by extension ‘be late’, and then ‘long time’. Gu, however, takes it as person with bundle of traditional Chinese herbs placed behind, for moxibustion; in this view, ‘long time’ is a loan use. KJ1970:258; YK1976:122; OT1968:24; GY2008:37.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 竟 (NJK, originally, ‘music piece ends’, now just ‘end, finish’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘boundary’, to give ‘boundary of land’. Katō links 竟 (and by extension, 境 ) to NJK 彊 , an older, more intricate graph (representing a near-homophone originally meaning ‘strong bow’ and then just ‘strong’) which was itself loaned for ‘boundary’, a sense subsequently reflected in the modified CO graph 疆 , which has 土 added). KJ1970:272; YK1976:134; OT1968:223; MS1995:v2:982-3,v1:472-3; AS2007:319,307. We suggest taking 竟 as its components 音 6 ‘sound’ and 儿 41 ‘(bent) legs/person’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 示 723 ‘altar, deity’, and 林 79 ‘forest’. Views differ on role of 林 . Taken either as phonetic with associated sense ‘keep back, restrain’, giving ‘the gods restrain’ (Katō, Yamada), and by extension ‘forbid’, or as semantic, giving ‘sacred area surrounded by forest’ (Tōdō, Shirakawa, Ogawa), again giving ‘forbid’ by extension.

Etymology: Seal ; seemingly a very late graph ( Yupian ). The element 牛 108 ‘ox, cow’ is taken to be an abbreviation for 牽 (NJK, originally ‘lead cow by a rope’; by extension, ‘be pulled/bound’), with 亻 41 ‘person’, to give overall meaning ‘person who is bound and not free’, i.e. ‘slave’. In ancient China, slaves were regarded as no more than objects, and hence extended senses such as ‘thing’. KJ1970:385-6; YK1976:156; MS1995:v2:834-5.

Has 阝 1907 ‘hill, mound’, and 僉 (CO, originally ‘many people agree’: see 500) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either ‘gather together’ (Katō, Yamada), giving ‘hills/mountains grouped together’, or ‘jagged, pointed, steep’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), giving ‘jagged/steep hills/mountains’, and ‘steep’ as a generalized meaning. Either interpretation leads to ‘dangerous’ as an extended meaning. KJ1970:375; TA1965:847-8; OT1968:1069. We suggest taking as ‘odd’ elder brother 兄 114 under cover/cap 亼 .

Yamada takes as phonetic with associated sense ‘appear’, to give ‘luster of jade’, with ‘appear’ as a loan usage. ‘Luster of jade’ is supported by Qiu as original meaning for 現 , who also treats ‘appear’ as a loan usage for this graph. Ogawa, alternatively, takes 見 as semantic and phonetic, to give ‘luster of jade appears’, later generalized to ‘appear (before one’s eyes)’. YK1976:163-4; OT1968:657; QX2000:342.

Etymology: Late graph, no seal form. Traditional form 鐄 . Originally written 磺 (CO; a seal form for this does exist) or 礦 . 磺 has 石 47 ‘stone, rock’, and 黃 (traditional form of 黄 133 ‘yellow’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘yellow’, to give ‘yellow rock’. Used originally for yellowish mineral-bearing rock (ore), and then extended to ‘ore’ in general. In the other similar graph 礦 , which importantly provides the link to the modern form, 廣 (traditional form of 広 127 ‘wide, extensive’) was substituted – probably as a phonetic loan – for 黃 133 based on their near-homophony in early Chinese. At a later stage, the 石 determinative in 礦 was replaced by 金 16 ‘metal’, to give 鑛 , which has been simplified in modern Japanese to 鉱 . KJ1970:325; YK1976:185; OT1968:1039; AS2007:285,266.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 昆 1357 (NJK, originally ‘crawling insect’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘water spirals up from the ground’ (Katō, Yamada), echoed by Gu, who says ‘water flows abundantly’. Spiralling indicated ‘eddy’, then ‘mix’ and ‘confusion’. (Mizukami notes alternative possible analysis of 昆 as ‘many people gather in the sunlight’, but Katō disagrees.) KJ1970:413-4, MS1995:v1:612-3; YK1976:192; GY2008:1319. We suggest taking 日 as ‘sun’ 66 and 比 as ‘compare’ 792.

  • 雑音 [ZATSUON] - noise, static
  • 雑兵 [ZŌHYŌ] - ‘rank and file’

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 雜. Original way of writing was 襍 , consisting of 衤 ( 衣 ) 444 ‘(upper) garment, clothing’, and 集 324 (‘gather, collect’, originally birds gathering in a tree) as semantic and phonetic, to give ‘garment made of various colored cloths gathered together’. Subsequently the meaning became focused as ‘gather (a variety)’ and the shape modified to 雜 , which in turn led to the form 雑 used in modern Japanese writing, probably through earlier cursivizing. FC1974:v2:2396; KJ1970:432; YK1976:205; OT1968:1078. As a mnemonic, we suggest taking the modern graph’s three components, 集 bird(s)/gather, with 木 73 ‘tree’ and 九 13 ‘nine’.

KJ1970:60; YK1976:209-10; OT1968:1028. We suggest taking right hand part as ‘crossed legs’ 夂 (see Appendix), and ‘runny nose’ .

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 贊. Has 貝 10 ‘shell/currency’, and 兟 ‘advance’ ( 先 51 ‘tip, precede’ reduplicated; in early Chinese also meant ‘go in front’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘put forward/present shell currency or valuables’ as a gift when meeting one’s lord. As this would facilitate the meeting, ‘help’ evolved as an extended sense. Yamada proposes ‘praise’ as a further extension of meaning. KJ1970:441-2; KJ1975:210; OT1968:958; ZY2009:v1:52; AS2007:527. We suggest taking as ‘two husbands’ 夫 601.

Level: L3
Number: 717

Examples:
  • 支店 [SHITEN] - branch office
  • 支持 [SHIJI] - support
  • 支え柱 [sasaebashira] - prop

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Represents a bamboo stalk or a branch with leaves attached, held in the hand; taken to signify pulling the branch or stalk away, and hence ‘separate (with the hand)’. The Shuowen explanation says ‘bamboo’ ( 竹 58), but not all commentators are convinced by such precise identification (Ogawa, Shirakawa). No doubt because the hand is supporting a branch or bamboo stalk, Ogawa regards ‘support’ as an extended meaning, and does not follow Yamada’s view that ‘support’ is a loan usage. In modern usage, 支 is often used for ‘support’ in a figurative sense (cf. 枝 719 ‘branch’). KJ1970:460; YK1976:212; OT1968:434; SS1984:359.

Has 心 164 ‘mind, heart’, and 之 (see 143, originally ‘footprint’ &gt; ‘go, proceed’) – in a variant shape later rendered as 士 ‘warrior’ 521 – as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘go’, to give ‘one’s mind goes/tends towards…’, and hence ‘intend, intention’. KJ1970:452; OT1968:359; YK1976:218-9; AS2007:613.

Etymology: OBI forms , ; seal . Originally a picto-gram of an altar (also shown as 礻 ) for sacrifice to the gods. Theories about the shorter top horizontal line vary, and include a sacrifice, an ancestral tablet, or a deity image. The two lower sloping strokes are taken to indicate blood from a sacrifice, or ritual wine used for cleansing an offering. Despite some divergence on points of detail, there is agreement on the basic meaning of this graph as an altar. ‘Show’ may be an extended sense, related to outcome of the ritual involved. MS1995:v2:936-7; YK1976:226; KJ1970:446-7; GY2008:132; OT1968:717; AS2007:467.

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Seal form has 亻 41 ‘person’, and or 厶 (not to be confused with katakana ム ) (originally possibly a person with a plow [i.e. ‘farmer], but see 以 443) as phonetic with associated sense ‘same appearance’, to give ‘a person’s appearance is the same as another’s’, hence ‘resemble’. KJ1970:479,13; YK1976:229; MS1995:v1:54-5; OT1968:151. Mnemonically challenging, but we suggest taking the right hand and left hand elements as persons, and the central element as a plow.

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Seal form has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 射 893 (‘shoot arrow’) as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘depart’ (possibly with a semantic link also, with regard to an arrow leaving a bow), to give ‘words of farewell’. The meaning is considered to be extended to ‘words of thanks’ in the context of leaving after receiving a gift. Gu also makes this link, though he also proposes the above OBI equivalent, interpreting it as two hands holding up a mat taken away when departing government office, presumably with words of thanks (the same OBI form is interpreted differently by Mizukami, who sees it as an early predecessor of 識 – see 725). Gu’s interpretation involving a mat would appear to be reinforced by the OBI forms which Mizukami lists for 席 549 ‘seat’ (originally, pictograms of a mat, and interpreted in that way by Mizukami himself). MS1995:v2:1210-11,v1:440-41; KJ1970:490-91; YK1976:240; OT1968:941; GY2008:1514. As a mnemonic we suggest using the English slang term, ‘shoot off’, meaning depart (in some haste).

Examples:

  • 教授 [KYŌJU] - tuition, professor

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). In early Chinese a word meaning ‘give’ was written with the graph 受 319 ‘receive’ (see OBI form for 319); in that early period the two words concerned, ‘give’ and ‘receive’, which were near-homophones, were distinguished in written texts on the basis of context. At the seal script stage, however, the ‘hand’ determinative 扌 ( 手 ) 34 was added to the near-homophone meaning ‘give’ so as to aid clarity. With regard to the case of 授 , the phonetic element 受 is more appropriately taken as ‘hand over’ (Katō) rather than ‘receive’ (Yamada). The meaning ‘teaching’ is an extended sense, with regard to conferring knowledge. KJ1970:507-8; AS2007:470; QX2000:189; YK1976:247. As a mnemonic, we suggest making use of three hands.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 行 131 ‘go’ and 朮 (originally hand with sticky grains: see also 731) as phonetic with associated sense ‘follow’ (Ogawa, Tōdō) or ‘bend, winding’ (Katō, Yamada), to give basic meaning ‘path’, or ‘winding’ (Katō, Yamada). Senses such as ‘means, method’ are seen as extended usage from following a path. This graph and 述 731 ‘relate’ are treated by Schuessler as representing the same basic word in early Chinese, and Tōdō also includes in the same word-family (‘follow a route’). OT1968:898; TA1965:682-6; KJ1970:527; YK1976:261; AS2007:473. As with 731, we suggest taking as ‘odd tree’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 隼 (CO, ‘hawk’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull a rope straight’, giving ‘level surface of water’; later, meaning was generalised to ‘level’. Extended meanings ‘conform’ and ‘quasi-’ are based on keeping to or being close to a level or standard. 凖 (with 冫 401 ‘ice’ not ‘water’) is a variant form but now with separate status (see 1475). KJ1970:529; TA1965:682; YK1976:263. Suggest taking 隼 as 十 35 ‘ten’ and 隹 324 ‘bird’.

Has 广 127 ‘building, roof’, and 予 425 (originally ‘weaving shuttle’, modern meaning ‘prior, already’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘external wall’, to give ‘(external) house walls’. ‘Beginning’ may perhaps be a derived sense (what is there first, before roof and internal walls added); ‘order’, though, is regarded as a loan usage. KJ1970:552; YK1976:267; OT1968:327.

Alternatively, taken as ‘bend’, a meaning listed by Tōdō, based on 刀 198 ‘knife’ as phonetic in 召 , where it signifies ‘bend, bent’, based on curved shape of knife, to signify calling someone over with hand movement, i.e. ‘beckon’.

Examples:

  • 継承者 [KEISHŌSHA] - successor

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). It comprises 手 34 ‘hand’, and 丞 (NJK, helping someone up, ‘lift up, help’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘raise up’, to give ‘lift up with the hands’, or ‘receive with hands held up’. Use of this graph seems to have related to ‘raise up’ and also ‘receive’ in a physical sense in early Chinese, and it came to be used in Japanese from quite an early stage with the latter meaning to represent a verb which, to give it its modern form, is uketamawaru ‘receive (from a superior)’, often to denote a verbal reference such as orders, and also historically as a polite verbal suffix. This background of use for 承 probably goes some way towards accounting for its additional senses in modern Japanese such as ‘hear’ and ‘know’. KJ1970:547-8; OT1968:403,19; YK1976:269; AS2007:185. Suggest taking the graph as a whole, involving 子 27 ‘child’ and 水 42 ‘water’, with the extra cross-strokes taken as bristles.

Etymology: Seal forms ( 證 ), ( 証 ). These are late graphs ( Shuowen ), the traditional form being 證 . The traditional form consists of 言 118 ‘words; speak’, with 登 382 (‘climb’) as phonetic with an associated sense of ‘clarify’, to give ‘clarify with words, report facts clearly, prove’. The (originally) separate graph 証 once represented a near-homophone meaning ‘remonstrate’, but over time the simpler graph 証 came to be used in place of 證 , a choice made official in Japan in 1946. OT1968:924-5; AS2007:612; QX2000:313. We suggest taking the modern form as 言 118 ‘words’ with 正 43 ‘correct’.

Etymology: Seal .

Has 米 220 ‘rice’, and 青 45 ‘green, blue, fresh’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘clean’, to give ‘rice polished clean’ (Ogawa), or ‘select and clean rice’ (Katō, Yamada). The process of cleaning rice involved refining, hence ‘refine’. ‘Essence, spirit’ may be seen as an extended sense – that which remains after refining – and by further extension to ‘vitality’.

Ogawa takes the associated sense of 責 as ‘accumulate’, giving ‘accumulate thread’ – a little awkward but helps explain ‘achievements’ as an extended sense. KJ1970:614; YK1976:310; OT1968:790.

Tōdō includes in a word-family ‘slender point; slender point thrusts in’, giving a clear original sexual connotation. TA1965:848-51; KJ1970:623; YK1976:311.

Seal form onwards with 言 118 ‘words, speak’ is widely taken as an error; likely due to misinterpretation of certain older forms of 言 which include a wedge-shaped component. MS1995:v2:1184-5; KJ1970:618-9; YK1976:311; OT1968:545. Take 殳 as ‘hand holding tool/weapon’.

Examples:

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 金 16 ‘metal/gold’ (in ancient China, often used for ‘bronze’), and 戔 545 (two halberds &gt; ‘fight, injure’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘tip is scraped away’, to give ‘metal implement with tip/edge scraped away’; taken to signify tools – often agricultural implements – such as spades, hoes, or knives. The connection with coinage and money is that, dating from the first millennium BC in China, there have survived examples of metal currency (separate from shell currency) actually in the shape of small knives or spades, and featuring short inscriptions; Qiu suggests that before the beginning of the formal use of money, spades probably served as a kind of currency in trade relations. In Japan, a new monetary system was adopted officially in 1871. The main unit in this decimal system was the yen, so called because the yen coins were round ( 円 4 ‘round, yen’), unlike the earlier oblong coins. As a lesser monetary unit, the ‘sen’ was adopted (one-hundredth of a yen); sen coins are no longer legal as currency, but the sen is still used sometimes in financial transactions. KJ1970:626; YK1976:319; QX2000:258-9. We suggest for the first mnemonic taking 金 in its meaning of ‘gold’, and for the second,‘ money.

Strokes: 10
Level: L1
Number: 759

Examples:
  • 元素 [GENSO] - element
  • 要素 [YŌSO] - factor
  • 素足 [SUashi] - barefoot

Etymology: Seal . The graph consists of / 糸 29 ‘thread’ (‘silk thread’), and (originally, tree blossoms or leaves hanging down); the function and meaning of the latter element – which has been modified through simplification in the block script version – is disputed. One view takes as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘white’, to give ‘white silk’ (Katō, Yamada, Mizukami), or ‘separate into two’ (Mizukami), to give ‘white silk threads hanging separately’. Tōdō, by contrast, considers ‘white threads/silk’ to be an extended sense, and the original meaning to be ‘the original state’. Normally, however, the words and meanings represented by individual graphs progress from the concrete to the abstract, not vice versa, so the first interpretation above is probably the one to follow. Yamada gives a useful view regarding the overall semantic progression for this graph, namely ‘white silk’ generalized to ‘white’, then to ‘plain’ and ‘raw material’; ‘element’ may be regarded as coming within the same semantic spectrum. Mizukami looks to identify a corresponding bronze form. KJ1970:640; YK1976:323; MS1995:v2:1008-9,v1:22; TA1965:368-71.

The second seal form here has 辶 85 ‘move, go’, and this reflects a widely discernible feature in the older forms of certain graphs, which exhibit variation between 彳 and the semantically close 辶 . Mizukami looks to identify two possible bronze forms for 退 . Distinguish 艮 here from the same-shaped element ‘stop and stare back’ in 銀 281 ‘silver’ (though a useful mnemonic), and from 良 628 ‘good’.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 是 1574 (originally, pictograph of spoon on a hook; now ‘proper, this’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hold in the hand (something hanging down)’, to give ‘hold, carry’. In Tōdō’s word-family ‘straight’, meaning ‘hold straight up’ (the object is vertical, so does not conflict significantly with the other interpretation noted above). ‘Offer’ is an extended sense.

The graph has 禾 87 ‘grain’, with 呈 (modern form 呈 1741 ‘express clearly’; itself comprising 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, with [CO ‘stand up straight’, ‘excel’] as phonetic with associated sense ‘show’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put in order’ (Yamada, Katō) or ‘extend straight’ (Ogawa), to give ‘order, rule, standard’. Katō notes a connection with a unit of measure (‘put grain harvest in order by units of volume’). ‘About, approximately’ may be a further extension of meaning on the basis of being close to a standard. YK1976:375; KJ1970:709-10; OT1968:734; MS1995:v1:262-3; KZ2001:1877/3671. Take 王 as ‘king’ 5.

Yamada looks to identify several OBI forms, but Mizukami does not include any. YK1976:401-2; KJ1970:567; OT1968:51. We suggest taking 壬 as an ‘odd’ variant of ‘king’ 王 5.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 刂 198 ‘knife/cut’, and 半 214 (‘half’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘divide in two’, to give ‘divide in two physically with knife/cleaver’. Later, extended to‘divide’ in general, and further senses such as ‘dissect’ and ‘decide, judge’. The meaning‘seal’ (Japanese only) seems to relate to early practice of dividing important documents with seals (similar to signatures in the West) such as contracts in two, one half for each party.

Technological development in China in first millennium AD saw 版 used to refer to wooden blocks engraved with text and/or illustrations in woodblock printing, and widely in printing terms.

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Two people in line. Original meaning ‘lined up’ was extended based on comparing two similar entities. Originally, early Chinese words for ‘lined up’ and ‘follow’ were both represented in written form by one person next to another, and as Mizukami points out, OBI for these two words were written sometimes facing right, sometimes left; later the convention became established to write facing right for this graph 比 , and ‘follow’ (block script 从 [the original way of writing 従 – see 902]) facing left.

In this graph 巴 162 serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘one thing added on top of another’, to give ‘fleshy’; by extension, ‘become fat/enriched’. It is in Tōdō’s word-family ‘fat, thick’. YK1976:422; KJ1970:798; TA1965:730-32. We suggest taking the right-hand element as ‘bending body’ 巴 162.

Examples:

  • 土俵 [DOHYŌ] - sandbag, sumo ring

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Yupian ). Has 亻 41 person’, and 表 402 (‘surface, list, appear’) as phonetic. Most commentators do not give an associated sense for 表 . One exception is Katō, who refers to a light illness quickly recovered from; and Yamada, who says ‘move nimbly’, giving an overall sense ‘nimble person’, on the basis that 俵 is perhaps a variant form of another graph similar in pronunciation, i.e. 僄 , CO meaning ‘light, nimble’; Katō shares this view. In the Yupian dictionary the meaning of 俵 is noted as ‘distribute’, though Katō notes 俵 was also sometimes used in Han time texts in the sense of 表 . In Japanese only, 俵 is used exclusively with a different meaning, i.e. ‘bag, sack (for rice, etc.)’. The word DOHYŌ ( 土俵 ) means ‘sumo wrestling ring’ as well as ‘bag filled with sand (or similar)’, but this just reflects the fact that traditionally the ring is formed with sandbags. The explanation for use of 俵 for ‘sack, bag’ in Japanese may be that 表 originally referred to an enveloping outer garment, and similarly a bag or sack is itself an enveloping cover.

Examples:

  • 暴れ者 [abaremono] - roughneck

Etymology: Seal forms i] , ii] . Seal forms vary in shape (Yamada lists three, including i] and ii]). Amidst such variation, the form with 米 220 ‘rice’ is considered to be the correct semantic element, combining with another component; Qiu notes that the form with 米 occurs on Qin dynasty (221-206BC) bamboo slips (clerical script). Commentators vary in their interpretation of the component which is combined with 米 , but those proposed, which include 曓 (‘sudden illness’) (Yamada), are taken as serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘expose to the sun’, giving the overall sense ‘dry rice by exposing to the sun’; later, the sense was generalized to ‘expose to the sun’. Mizukami lists what he treats as a bronze equivalent for 暴 which is of different structure, being ‘sun’ with an element thought to represent an animal, again meaning ‘expose to the sun’, in this case as a sacrifice. The meaning ‘violence’ is probably a loan usage. In the block script form 暴 , the bottom element is in error for 米 . YK1976:458-9; MS1995:v1:626-7; QX2000:200-01; KJ1970:776-7; OT1968:474. We suggest taking the components as 日 66 ‘sun’, 共 484 ‘together’, and 氺 as ‘insufficient water’ ( 水 42).

Etymology: Seal form A ; seal form B . Shuowen has as separate entries, seemingly taking them as representing same word ‘dream’. Form B, later prevailing, has 夕 46 ‘moon, night’ and as phonetic with associated sense ‘cannot see clearly; dark’, in one view ‘dark night’ (Katō, Ogawa; for them ‘dream’ is loan usage). Form A includes 宀 30 ‘roof, building’ and 爿 739 ‘bed’, but Qiu feels these were misunderstood by Shuowen compiler Xu Shen. Later, top four strokes of Form B were written as 艹 53 ‘plants’. KJ1970:848; DJ2009:553,601-2; QX2000:230-31; OT1968:232. Take 艹 as ‘grass’ 53, 76 as ‘eye(s)’, and 冖 as cover.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 令 633 (‘order, rule over’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘upright’, to give ‘upright part of the head’, i.e. ‘neck’. The current meanings are perhaps extended senses, based on the concept of the head being a chief part and derivates from that. YK1976:499; KJ1970:917; OT1968:1104; AS2007:318.

MS1995:v1:536-7; YK1976:56-7; KJ1970:27-8; OT1968:217. Suggest taking 口 as entrance, and as one/sole.

Later used also for ‘tree stump’. The meaning ‘stocks, shares (in a company)’ seems to be an extended use which refers to the central supporting part of a firm/company.YK1976:99-100; AS2007:625; OT1968:505; KJ1970:506.

  • 干し肉 [hoshiNIKU] - dried meat

Etymology: OBI . Originally depicted a forked weapon, possibly made from a tree branch; appears to be a simpler version of the weapon originally represented by 単 569, possibly with a handguard. The later sense ‘shield’ is considered a loan usage (Ogawa suggests instead that this occurred through confusion with old forms of 盾 1474, but there is limited similarity in shape). Yamada considers the meaning ‘dry’ reflects use of 干 as a loan graph for the more complex 乾 1145 ‘dry’ (homophonous in early Chinese, as in modern Japanese). OT1968:321; YK1976:100; MS1995:v1:446-7; KJ1970:202-3; AS2007:248-9.

Has 卩 41 ‘person kneeling’ (Katō and Yamada take here with extended sense ‘bent knee’), and (originally ‘scatter grain seeds by hand’: see 688) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shape into ball, bend, curve’, to give overall meaning ‘bent knee’; later generalized to ‘bend, wind’. Traditionally in China and Japan, books were made by binding into rolls, hence the meaning ‘(book) volume’ also. YK1976:102; MS1995:v1:176-7; KJ1970:178-9; OT1968:147. As with 688, we suggest taking as ‘two’ 二 65, ‘fires’ 火 8, and ‘self’ 己 866.

One consists of 手 34 ‘hand’ over 目 76 ‘eye’, while the other comprises 目 ‘eye’ with 倝 (‘sun shining high in the sky’: see 667) as phonetic with associated sense ‘watch stealthily’. The interpretation of both forms is ‘watch with gaze shielded by the hand’ (Katō, Yamada), though Ogawa says ‘look into the distance’. YK1976:102; KJ1970:212-3; OT1968:696.

Ogawa says associated phonetic sense is ‘scrape’, to give ‘(bamboo) strip for writing’. YK1976:107; MS1995:v2:992-3; OT1968:758; KJ1970:218.

Strokes: 6

Examples:
  • 危機 [KIKI] - crisis
  • 危険 [KIKEN] - danger
  • 危害 [KIGAI] - harm

Etymology: Seal ( Shuowen ); 厃 (earlier form of 危 ) . Scholars take 厃 as the simpler form of 危 . 厃 depicts a person kneeling or squatting down fearfully on top of a cliff or roof; to this, the later, more complex form 危 adds an additional element for ‘kneel/bend’, (see 789), which is regarded as both semantic and phonetic in function. The overall sense ‘kneel/crouch down fearfully on top of a cliff/roof’ gives rise to ‘dangerous, afraid’ as the extended sense. Mizukami also lists a proposed OBI equivalent, but the shape is not convincing. YK1976:109-10; MS1995:v1:178-9; KJ1970:249-50; OT1968:146. We suggest taking as fallen figure.

Etymology: Seal . Has 貝 10 ‘shell, shell currency’, and 臾 (NJK graph, originally a large basket [for carrying soil, etc.]) as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘pile up high’, thus giving ‘pile shell currency/valuables up high’. This was then generalized to ‘precious’, and by extension to ‘noble’. Mizukami looks to identify equivalent OBI and bronze forms, though these lack the element 貝 .YK1976:117; MS1995:v2:1234-5; KJ1970:245-6; GY2008:855. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 貝 in its original meaning of shell, and the upper part as a ‘strange’ variant of 虫 60 ‘insect’.

The second seal form (ii]) is given as the main graph, comprising 勹 (‘embrace, envelop’: see 611), and 凶 1215 (originally ‘empty mouth’) as phonetic. 凶 is taken as having associated sense either ‘empty’, giving ‘empty space in the chest for breathing’, generalized to ‘chest’ (Katō, Yamada, Tōdō), or ‘be nervous/excited’, giving ‘feel uneasiness’ (Ogawa). The former interpretation seems persuasive. 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’ was added to what was originally just 匈 ( Shuowen has 匈 as the main entry heading, noting that it is sometimes written with 月 added). KJ1970:269; YK1976:132; TA1965:302-7; OT1968:132,820; DJ2009:v2:735.

OT1968:129,217; YK1976:140; KJ1970:294-5; MS1995:270-71. Here 艹 is not ‘plant’ 53, but we suggest use as such, and take as 生 44 ‘grow’ in (seed-) box 囗 .

The basic underlying meaning of 筋 is ‘distinct lines’, and hence ‘sinew, tendon, muscle’. YK1976:140; KJ1970293-4; OT1968:750.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 刂 ( 刀 ) 198 ‘sword, cut’, and (mythical beast with tiger’s head) as phonetic with associated sense ‘extremely violent, extreme’. It is felt to be an erroneous variant, which should properly have 力 78 ‘strength, effort’, not 刀 ( 刂 ). Modern scholars typically analyze in terms of the version with 力 , and this approach is followed here. Thus taken as 力 ‘effort, strength’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘extremely violent, extreme’ (though Ogawa interprets as ‘busy’), giving ‘exert oneself to the utmost’. YK1976:152; KJ1970:362-3; SS1984:182-3; OT1968:122. We suggest taking as tiger (‘tiger determinative’: see 297 and 1301) with 豕 89 ‘pig’.

Katō takes as ‘rise up’, thus ‘water rises/jumps up’, but the view based on ‘hit hard’ seems preferable. SS1984:197,247; GY2008:1621; KJ1970:359-60; OT1968:609; TA1965:267.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional . Has 木 73 ‘tree’, and 468 (‘crested bird’) as phonetic with associated sense either as ‘yellow’, giving ‘tree with yellow blossoms’ (Yamada), or with associated sense unknown, giving ‘a type of tree’ (Katō); either way, the precise type of tree is not known. Meanings such as ‘authority, right, balance’ represent a loan usage of 権 instead of , a CO graph of 扌 34 ‘hand’ with as phonetic with associated sense ‘fist-sized weights’ for scales, giving ‘scales with weights for balancing by hand’ (Katō); Ogawa, alternatively, takes the weights as hanging, and supports this with an illustration of a weight in a bell shape which was made for hanging. At first weights were made of stone, but later metal. The operator of the scales had some discretion when weighing items, thus giving extended senses such as ‘balance’ and ‘power, authority’. In Japanese, ‘balance’ is now a very minor meaning for 権 . KJ1970:341-2; YK1976:160; OT1968:522.

Alternatively, seen as 木 ‘tree’ with 囗 ‘confining enclosure’ to restrain growth (Tōdō, Ogawa). With either view, ‘be in difficulties’ may be regarded as an extended sense, though perhaps more convincingly in the latter interpretation. KJ1970:412-3; YK1976:191; TA1965:712-21; OT1968:204.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 濟 . Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 齊 (orig showing ears of grain [Mizukami, Ogawa, Tōdō], or three hairpins [Shirakawa]) as phonetic, but views differ over associated and overall senses. Katō takes phonetic as ‘clear’, thus ‘river with clear water’ (also, river name), but Shirakawa and Ogawa, while also noting as a river name, take 齊 as ‘cross over’, thus ‘cross over water’, and by extension ‘assist (people)’ and hence ‘accomplish, complete’. Another view takes 齊 as having associated sense ‘adjust’, to give ‘adjust flow (water volume) of a river’ so as to even out (without flooding, etc.; Tōdō), and thus ‘be/make uniform, settled’. KJ1970:586; TA1965:770-73; MS1995:v2:1524-5,786-7; OT1968:1171,590; SS1984:338. Suggest take as 文 72 ‘text’ and strange ‘moon’ 月 18.

  • 蚕豆 [soramame*] - broad bean

Etymology: OBI ; seal ; traditional 蠶 . OBI form is pictograph of silkworm. Seal has 60 ‘insects’ and 朁 ( 曰 NJK ‘speak’, with 兓 [two hairpins] as phonetic with associated sense ‘insert’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘produce’ (Katō, Ogawa, Yamada), thus ‘insect which produces thread’ i.e. ‘silkworm’. Tōdō, however, takes associated sense as ‘enter narrow space’, and sees it to indicate burrowing, thus ‘insect that burrows (into mulberry leaves)’. The modern Japanese graph 蚕 serves as a simplified version of 蠶 , but is in origin a separate graph meaning ‘earthworm’. Note too that middle part of traditional form 蠶 is 曰 ‘speak’ (orig showing tongue in mouth), a determinative slightly different in shape from 日 66 ‘sun/day’ in traditional printed form, though the difference is obscured in modern Japanese usage, which usually has both as 日 .

  • 私事 [SHIJI] - personal matters

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 禾 87 ‘grain’ (not just ‘rice’), and 厶 , which based on its OBI form is usually taken as corrupted version of 囗 84 ‘enclosure’ (Katō, Ogawa, Yamada), but Mizukami takes 厶 as ‘enclose and make one’s own’; either way, overall sense is ‘grain which is one’s own’. The ancient Chinese tax system required part of the harvest to be given up as tax, and what remained was denoted by the graph 私 ; ‘grain which is one’s own/mine’ subsequently became generalised to ‘private, I, me’. KJ1970:459-60; OT1968:727; YK1976:219; MS1995:v1:188-90; SS1984:357-8. Suggest taking 厶 as a nose.

Etymology: OBI ( ) ; seal . Views diverge. OBI form has just a raised pair of hands, and an element taken as dishevelled hair, together interpreted as meaning a shamaness dancing while shaking her hair wildly. Seal form on has 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’ added to , which itself reflects the original pair of raised hands having been changed to (misinterpreted as) 艹 53 ‘vegetation’. One view takes 若 as 口 ‘speak’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft, weak, supple’, giving ‘speak in compliant/submissive manner’ (Katō, Yamada). Another view treats instead as 艹 ‘vegetation’ with 右 2 (‘right’) in its original sense ‘hand’, giving ‘pick soft young leaves’ (Tōdō). Both views are noted by Mizukami. ‘If’ is a loan usage.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 收 . Has 又 , which here is not 又 2003 ‘again’ (originally ‘hand’), but a corruption of 攵 ( 攴 ) 112 ‘hit with stick (or similar); compel’, and 丩 ‘intertwine’ (originally, pictograph of intertwined vines, string or similar) as phonetic with associated sense taken variously as ‘see/watch over’ or ‘draw together’ (both listed by Mizukami), ‘search exhaustively’ (Yamada), or ‘supervise’ (Katō). The overall sense is felt to be ‘search for and capture’ (Yamada, Katō, Mizukami); Mizukami also lists ‘bring together that which is separate/scattered’ as an alternative meaning.MS1995:v1:566-7,12-13; KJ1970:511-12; YK1976:248-9; OT1968:154.

Yamada’s interpretation results in ‘vertical’ as a loan usage (as also Katō), while in other analyses it is a generalized sense. The lesser meanings of ‘wayward’, ‘selfishness’ are extensions related to the idea of looseness (Katō). YK1976:257; TA1965:301; OT1968:787; KJ1985:488.

Seal form has as above, but the ‘hand’ component is equivalent to 寸 920 (‘hand’, ‘unit of measure’), with little if any change of overall meaning, which is ‘offer up meat’. ‘Lead, command’ is considered to be either a loan usage (Katō, Yamada), or an extended sense based on the person making the offering being someone of status, hence ‘lead; leader’. Also used in early Chinese as a convenient loan for a grammatical function word meaning ‘be about to’, then also in Japanese. YK1976:271; KJ1970:582; AS2007:306.

Schuessler gives the meaning as ‘dike, dam up’. All the above interpretations give ‘prevent, hinder’ as a generalized sense. YK1976:276; OT1968:1074; TA1965:352; AS2007:607.

Etymology: Seal . Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 𠂹 (originally pictograph of blossoms and leaves hanging down; Kangxi zidian quotes Yupian , which treats as an old form of 垂 ) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hang down’, giving ‘land in remote regions’. Schuessler suggests the semantic progression ‘far end (of a place)’ &gt; ‘border, frontier’. Mizukami takes as ‘ends of the earth, where the sky hangs down’, a meaning perhaps related to ancient Chinese concepts of the Earth. ‘Hang down’ is a generalized sense.

This stroke is typically taken as signifying one unit of measure (i.e. one ‘sun’) back from the wrist, giving ‘wrist pulse’ and by extension ‘measure’ (Yamada, Ogawa). Schuessler gives the meanings as ‘thumb; inch’, and lists ‘measure’ as a loan writing for a near-homophone of that meaning. YK1976:294-5; OT1968:285; KJ1970:579; AS2007:200.

Examples:
  • 洗礼 [SENREI] - baptism

  • 手洗い [tearai] - toilet, washroom

Etymology: Seal . Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 先 51 (‘tip’, ‘point’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘barefoot’, giving ‘pour water on bare feet’; Yamada regards ‘wash’ as a loan usage, but it seems more appropriate to take it as a generalized sense based on a more specific original meaning. YK1976:317; MS1995:v2:748-50; KJ1970:627-8.

Examples:
  • 染色 [SENSHOKU] - dyeing
  • 染物 [somemono] - dyed goods
  • 染込む [shimikomu] - soak into

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. One takes as 氵 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 朵 (CO, vegetation or blossoms hanging on tree) as phonetic with associated sense ‘dangle in salty medium’, giving ‘soak (meat) in salty solution’; in this analysis, ‘dye (fabrics)’ is seen as extended sense through using a similar process, hanging cloth in a dye solution (Katō, Yamada). Tōdō analyzes as 氵 ‘water’ with 杂 , as variant form of 簋 , a CO denoting square container with a round inside, used to hold dye solution. Ogawa takes as 木 73 ‘tree’, with CO 氿 ‘oozing liquid’ &gt; ‘dye from vegetation’. YK1976:317; OT1968:575; TA1965:840-41; KJ1970:628-9. Suggest take elements as 氵 42 ‘water’, 木 73 ‘tree’, and 九 13 ‘nine’.

The seal form in Shuowen is equivalent to 窻 , which has 心 164 ‘heart, feeling’ added, but there is no satisfactory explanation of the role of 心 as yet. YK1976:328; OT1968:742; MS1995:v2:976-7; KJ1970:586. Suggest taking as ‘hole’ 穴 , ‘feeling’ 心 , and ‘nose’ ム .

Examples:
  • 装置 [SŌCHI] - device

  • 変装 [HENSŌ] - disguise

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 裝 . Has 衣 444 ‘clothing’, and 壮 / 壯 1628 (‘manly, strong’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either i] ‘wrap clothing away’, giving ‘put away, prepare’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘long and slender/narrow’, giving ‘wear a long garment’ (Tōdō). The association with clothing appears to have given rise to the extended sense ‘gear/equipment’. ‘Adorn’ is a loan usage. OT1968:904; TA1965:378-80; DJ2009:v2:682. Suggest taking the components of 壮 , i.e. ‘bed’ 丬 739 and ‘samurai’ 士 521.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Traditional form has 曾 as lower element. Has 尸 , here not its usual ‘corpse, prone person’, but as abbreviation of 屋 meaning ‘roof, building’ (see 屋 256), and 曾 93 (orig. pictograph of double steamer) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘be piled up’, giving ‘building of two (or more) storeys’; later, sense was generalized to ‘pile up; layer’. Ogawa sees 尸 as an error for the different element 广 ‘building’ (e.g. 127). YK1976:329; KJ1970:320; OT1968:299. Suggest 尸 as ‘corpse’ 256, 丷 as variant of ‘eight’ 八 70, ‘field’ 田 63, and ‘day’ 日 66.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 藏 . Has 艹 53 ‘plants’, and 臧 (interpreted in one view as ‘slave punished’, comprising ‘slave’ 臣 543 with 戕 ‘wound’) as phonetic with associated. sense taken as i] ‘cover over to avoid people’s gaze’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘put away’ (Ogawa), in either case giving ‘cover/hide under plants’, and by extension ‘store away; storehouse’. Qiu, though, considers 藏 originally denoted a type of plant, and treats ‘store away’ as a loan use. KJ1970:434; OT1968:871; YK1976:332-3; QX2000:341-2; MS1995:v2:1084-6.

Level: L3
Number: 938

Examples:
  • 生存者 [SEIZONSHA] - survivor
  • 存在 [SONZAI] - existence
  • 存じる [ZONjiru] - know, think

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has (see 在 711), taken with possible meaning ‘blocked river’ or ‘be/exist’ (its precursor quite likely 才 139 [now meaning ‘talent’ q.v.]), and 子 27 ‘child’, widely taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘piled high’, thus ‘river blocked with piled soil’ (Katō, Yamada). Yamada also proposes extended senses ‘not move’ &gt; ‘stay, exist’. Ogawa treats as ‘exist’ and 子 as abbreviation of 孫 565 (‘descendants’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put in order’ extending to ‘exist, be’, but is unpersuasive. It is felt there is a link between 存 and 在 both as graphs and words in early Chinese, but uncertainty over the etymology of the graph 在 hampers our understanding of that for 存 . ‘Know, think’ seem to be extended or borrowed meanings. Suggest taking elements as hand holding stick , with 子 27 ‘child’. YK1976:338; KJ1970:421; OT1968:266; AS2007:200.

Examples:
  • 担当 [TANTŌ] - responsibility
  • 担い手 [ninaite] - bearer
  • 負担 [FUTAN] - burden

Etymology: Seal (orig 儋 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Traditional form of 担 is 擔 . Scholars agree that the original form of 擔 is 儋 , i.e. 亻 41 ‘person’, with 詹 as phonetic with associated sense ‘carry on the back’. In a later seal version, the left-hand determinative was changed from 亻 ’person’ to 扌 34 ‘hand’, giving 擔 , which can be seen as a variant form: the authoritative Kangxi zidian of 1716 lists 擔 as ‘the same as 儋 ’. The modern form 担 , which is treated as the abbreviated version of 擔 , is originally a graph of different meaning (‘strike, hit’) pressed into service as a substitute for the more complicated graph. YK1976:350; KJ1970:250; OT1968:408; ZY2009:v2:436,395. Suggest take right-hand part as ‘one’ 一 1 ‘day’ 日 66.

Etymology: Seal: ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 延 831 (’extend, stretch, postpone’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘extend’, giving ‘words extend out/are excessive’, deceit’. While this is the original meaning, the graph occurs more commonly in early usage as a loan for ‘give birth’, according to Tōdō, but Schuessler does not list ‘give birth’ among the early Chinese meanings. OT1968:935; TA1965:534-5; AS2007:553-4.

Examples:
  • 暖房 [DANBŌ] - heater
  • 暖流 [DANRYŪ] - warm current
  • 暖冬 [DANTŌ] - mild winter

Etymology: Seal ( 煖 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ); 暖 has 爰 (CO; ‘ceremonial disc’ [OBI equivalent originally shows hand pulling disc or similar]) as the right-hand element in the traditional form. Initially the determinative for this graph was 火 8 ‘fire, flames’, but later a variant evolved with 日 66 ‘sun’; 火 / 日 combined with 爰 as phonetic with associated sense ‘warm’. 煖 gives ‘warmth of a fire’, and 暖 gives ‘warmth of the sun’; over time, the latter became the standard form. YK1976:354; KJ1970:685-6; OT1968:473,631. Suggest taking the right-side part as three hands (in a variety of forms)

In either case, ‘price, value’ is loan usage. YK1976:356-7; KJ1970:691; OT1968:71; TA1965:88-90.

Etymology: Seal . Has 宀 30 ‘roof, building’, and 由 421 (originally, probably depicted a wine sieve or strainer; now means ‘reason’) as phonetic with associated sense taken provisionally as ‘cover’, giving ‘roof covering’ (Yamada, Katō), or ‘space beneath roof, extensive space’ (Ogawa); by extension, ‘space, the heavens’. Mizukami looks to identify OBI equivalents. YK1976:361; MS1995:v1:366-7; KJ1970:698-9; OT1968:275.

Examples:

Etymology: Late, post- Shuowen graph. Originally variant popular form of NJK 箸 ‘chopsticks’ (Qiu notes that in Han dynasty clerical script [see Introduction] there was alternation between 竹 58 ‘bamboo’ and 艹 53 ‘plant’ as determinative). 者 314 (modern meaning ‘person’) serves here as phonetic with associated sense ‘put between’, thus ‘bamboo to put things between’. In modern Japanese, meanings of 著 such as ‘write a book’, ‘notable’, are loan usages. See too 着 364 ‘wear, arrive’. YK1976:363; KJ1970:495; OT1968:859; QX2000:323-4.

  • 頂戴 [CHŌDAI] - receiving, please

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 丁 367 (originally pictograph of nail) as phonetic with associated sense ‘highest point’, giving ‘top of the head’; generalized to mean highest point, and hence ‘peak, summit’. According to Schuessler, in early Chinese homophones and near-homophones existed for ‘top of the head’ and ‘mountain top’; in similar fashion in Japanese, itadaki can mean ‘mountain top’ or ‘top of the head’, though the latter sense is relatively uncommon in modern Japanese. An extended sense in Japanese is ‘reverently accept’, from the traditional custom of raising a gift received to the head in thanks. The idea of receiving something has further extended to the meaning ‘please do something for me’. YK1976:366; OT1968:1100; GY2008:601; AS2007:211.

YK1976:371; OT1968:679; MS1995:v2:870-71; KJ1970:735-6. Suggest associating 甬 with 通 193 (‘pass [through]’).

Has 尸 256 (here) ‘person lying down’, and (as abbreviation of a more complex form with 衣 444 meaning a type of garment [Yamada says ‘red garment’]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘bend’, giving ‘person with bent back’, i.e. ‘hunchback’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘roll (over), tumble’, giving ‘turn in one’s sleep’ (Ogawa). Either analysis results in senses such as ‘lay (something) out, extend’ as loan usages. YK1976:379-80; KJ1970:728; OT1968:297. We suggest taking the top part as slumped person 尸 , middle part as 艹 53 ‘grass’, and lower part as ‘short’ clothing .

Has 言 118 ‘words, speak’, and 寸 920 (‘hand; measure’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘charge, accuse’, giving ‘charge verbally’, i.e. ‘charge (someone) with an offence’. Ogawa sees 寸 as an abbreviation here for 肘 (NJK ‘elbow’) with associated sense ‘capture’. ‘Attack (physically)’ can be seen as loan usage. Katō notes that in early times the elements corresponding to 寸 and 手 34 ‘hand’ were often used without distinction in meaning. YK1976:387-8; OT1968:923; KJ1970:673.

Either analysis could refer to a lattice roof-opening blackened with soot. ‘Party, (like-minded) companions’ are loan usage. YK1976:387; KJ1970:671-2; OT1968:90.

OT1968:764,327; YK1976:390; MS1995:v1:230-31; KJ1970:666. 唐 is also used to represent Tang China, helpful for mnemonics.

The graph has 尸 256 ‘person lying down/slumped’ (possibly but not necessarily a ‘corpse’), and 凷 (CO, ‘lump of hard soil’, made up of 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, with 凵 [originally, ‘basket’] as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘hard and round’) serving as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘move backwards’ or ‘leg impediment’, giving ‘move backwards, cannot move freely’ (Yamada, Katō), or ii] ‘collapse’, giving ‘physically enervated’ (Ogawa). Schuessler notes early Chinese meanings that include ‘end up, arrive’, which appear to be loan usages; ‘deliver’, which may perhaps be regarded as an extended sense from ‘end up, arrive’, is a meaning for 届 used only in Japanese. YK1976:397; KJ1970:153-4; OT1968:295; AS2007:314. We suggest taking 尸 as a corpse, and 由 as ‘reason’ 421.

<b>乳</b>
Reading: NYŪ,
Meaning: breasts,
Strokes: 8

Number: 961

Examples:
  • 牛乳 [GYŪNYŪ] - (cow’s) milk
  • 乳酸 [NYŪSAN] - lactic acid
  • 乳房 [NYŪBŌ/chibusa] - breasts

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Typically taken as 爫 (compact shape of 爪 1739, ‘claw, talon’ used in compound graphs), here meaning ‘hand’, and 孔 1316 ‘orifice, hole’ (originally ‘vaginal orifice’), giving ‘baby emerges from vaginal orifice and is received by hand’, i.e. ‘be born’. ‘Breast milk’ is treated by some (Katō, Yamada) as a loan usage, but can perhaps be regarded as an extended sense, as also ‘breasts’. Ogawa tentatively gives an alternative interpretation relating to an ancient belief, referred to in the Shuowen entry for 孔 , which links swallows to birth, but the first analysis above is probably the one to follow. YK1976:401; KJ1970:508; SS1984:670; OT1968:28. Note that 乚 is a cavity not a breast, though useful as a mnemonic. Thus we suggest ‘child’ 子 27 and 乚 ‘breast’ and ‘hand’ 爫 .

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 内 207 (‘inside’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘become wet’, giving ‘wet thread’; meanings such as ‘obtain; supply’ tend to be regarded as loan usages, though Tōdō notes an example of early classical usage of 納 in Chinese in the sense ‘bring inside’, a point echoed by Schuessler. YK1976:404-5; KJ1970:665; OT1968:770; TA1965:803; AS2007:446.

  • 脳障害 [N ŌSHŌGAI] - brain injury

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 腦 . For ‘brain’, Shuowen has 匘 , consisting of 𡿺 , originally a pictograph for ‘brain’ or ‘head, cranium’, with 匕 (the modern shape; originally, picto-graph for ‘withered leg’ and – by extension, based on the bent shape – borrowed for ‘ladle, spoon’ [Katō]; not to be confused with 七 32 ‘seven’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘fat, grease’, giving ‘fatty matter in the cranium’, i.e. ‘brain’ (Katō, Yamada). Alternatively, left side of seal form is taken as 人 41 ‘person’ (Shirakawa). Later, 匕 was replaced by 月 ( 肉 ) 209 ‘flesh, meat’. SS1984:675; YK1976:405; KJ1970:673-4,796; OT1968:823. We suggest taking 月 as body, and as ‘brain box’ with hairs on top.

Examples:
  • 肺病 [HAIBYŌ] - lung disease
  • 肺炎 [HAIEN] - pneumonia
  • 肺臓 [HAIZŌ] - lungs

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 市 (originally pictograph of plant emerging above ground [not 144 ‘market/city’]), taken in one analysis as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge from within’, to give ‘body organ from which breath emerges’, i.e. ‘lungs’ (Katō, Yamada). An alternative analysis based on the seal form (and the Shuowen interpretation) of 市 takes original meaning as leaves of a plant opening on opposite sides, giving both semantic and phonetic with associated sense ‘divide in two’, to give ‘organ divided in two’ (lungs) (Katō, Ogawa). The first analysis above seems preferable; the second might apply equally to ‘kidneys’. Suggest taking 市 as ‘city’ for mnemonic purposes. YK1976:409; KJ1970:753,472; TA1965:651; OT1968:820.

<b>俳</b>
Reading: HAI
Meaning: amusement,
Strokes: 10
Level: L1
Number: 969

Examples:
  • 俳優 [HAIYŪ] - actor
  • 俳句 [HAIKU] - haiku poetry
  • 俳人 [HAIJIN] - haiku poet

Etymology: Seal . Analyses differ. Probably most persuasive is that which takes as 亻 41 ‘person’, and 非 794 (‘not’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hunchback, ugly’, to give ‘(male) hunchback’. In ancient China, the nobles had many dwarf servants who were hunchbacks, and who would tell amusing stories and perform song and dance routines at banquets; on the basis of such activities, extended senses evolved such as ‘jest’ for 俳 (Katō, Yamada). In support of this view is the fact that in medieval Europe deformed persons were often employed as jesters. Ogawa prefers to analyze 非 as phonetic with associated sense ‘oppose, go against’, giving ‘persons who amuse others by doing unusual things’. Yamada looks to identify a bronze form for 俳 . KJ1970:754-5; YK1976:410; OT1968:71.

Examples:
  • 秘密 [HIMITSU] - secret

  • 秘書 [HISHO] - secretary

Etymology: Seal ( 祕 ). 秘 is a later popular form. 祕 has 示 723 (originally, ‘offering table, altar’, now means ‘show’), with 必 597 (‘necessarily’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘hide and not open’ (Yamada), ‘close’ (Ogawa), or ‘stick together and not allow movement’ (Tōdō), all signifying restriction in movement. Overall sense is ‘matters of the gods which are hidden and not clear/cannot leak outside’; later generalized to ‘hidden and not clear’, hence ‘secret’. The modern form using 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ as the determinative is probably a miscopying. YK1976:423; TA1965:765-9; OT1968:722; DJ2009:v1:5.

Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 复 (CO, an upright vessel with another one upside-down underneath, and 夊 or 夂 [for further details, see under 復 803; also see Note below]) as phonetic in 腹 with associated sense either i] ‘thick and abundant’, giving ‘thick and swollen part of the body’ (Yamada), or ii] ‘cover’, giving ‘flesh covering the internal organs’ (Ogawa), with overall meaning in both analyses ‘belly, abdomen’. YK1976:438-9; OT1968:825; MS1995:v1:286-8,v2:1078-9; OT1968:173. Note: traditional form of 腹 has 夂 ‘descending foot’ (determinative no. 34), though in some early occurrences of this graph it may have been 夊 ‘walk slowly, drag foot’; see Appendix.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 阜 / 阝 1907 ‘earthen mound’, and CO 坒 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘be lined up/in a row’, to give ‘series of earthen steps’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Katō and Yamada take 阜 / 阝 here as ‘foothold’ (treating steps as providing firm footing), giving ‘footholds for climbing a hill’, and from this Yamada posits ‘steps to the Imperial Palace’ as an extended sense. OT1968:1068; TA1965:768; KJ1970:836; YK1976:444. Suggest taking 坒 as 比 792 ‘compare’ and 土 64 ‘earth’.

Examples:

  • 片付ける [katazukeru] - tidy up

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form shows that 片 represents one side of a tree (see 木 73) split or cut in half vertically, giving literally ‘split tree’, and hence ‘one side’. The split is probably conceptual, since to achieve this with ancient tools would have been extremely difficult. QX2000:204; YK1976:445; OT1968:633; KJ1970:787.

Number: 981

Examples:
  • 補助 [HOJO] - support
  • 補充 [HOJŪ] - supplement
  • 補強 [HOKYŌ] - reinforcement

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); Has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and NJK 甫 ; scholars dispute orig. meaning of latter (modern meanings inc ‘begin’). It is felt that what is now the one shape 甫 may have once represented two separate graphs of similar but different shape and meaning (Katō, with some support from Mizukami). One analysis of 甫 (analysis i]) takes the OBI and bronze forms as signifying ‘use an ax’, which is the Shuowen interpretation (&lt; 父 originally ‘hand holding ax’; now ‘father’ 216), over 用 ‘use’ (a loan meaning; 235); this is one analysis listed by Mizukami, though none of the OBI forms he lists actually support this – rather, they support the alternative view ii] which Mizukami lists, i.e. taking the OBI and bronze forms as representing a shoot of vegetation ( 屮 ) in a field or seedbed. Another credible interpretation – iii] – is offered by Shirakawa, who takes the early forms of 甫 as showing a sapling with a framework supporting the lower part (interestingly, the OBI form Shirakawa lists supports the ‘use an ax’ interpretation). While there is divergence over the original meaning(s) of 甫 , there does appear to be some agreement over the function of this element in 補 , i.e. that 甫 here serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘add on, patch’. Later, the idea of ‘garment’ was lost from 補 , leading to generalised meanings such as ‘repair’, ‘add on’. MS1995:v2:870-71,v1:256-8; YK1976:450; KJ1970:857; OT1968:905; SS1984:777.

Later 咅 was replaced by 奉 1954 (‘offer’, ‘respect’). YK1976:458; KJ1970:759; OT1968:513; SS1984:800. Suggest taking as ‘big’ 大 56, 二 as ‘two’ 65, and as club with two nails.

The military government (Shogunate 1192-1867) was known as the ‘tent government’ ( 幕 府 Bakufu, referring initially to a large tent acting as field HQ), and so Shogunate/Bakufu became an associated meaning for 幕 .

Examples:
  • 卵黄 [RAN’Ō] - egg yolk
  • 産卵 [SANRAN] - spawning
  • 生卵 [namatamago] - raw egg

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views diverge. Several scholars take as a pictograph – Ogawa considers to originally denote frog spawn, and by extension ‘egg’; Tōdō is uncertain over the specific shape, but speculates to be possibly fish or insect eggs. The alternative treatment also takes as a pictograph, depicting not eggs but a pair of treadles on a loom, then borrowed on the basis of similarity in shape to represent ‘eggs’ (Katō, Yamada). The former view seems tentative, the latter more persuasive. OT1968:147; TA1965:555-6; KJ1970:146; YK1976:489-90. Suggest taking as frog spawn on stalks.

Based on classical Chinese usage, Shirakawa takes 覧 as action of high-ranking individuals, but Schuessler feels it may just represent a variant of the word represented by 監 1159. TA1965:807; YK1976:490; SS1984:866; AS2007:305-6.

Etymology: OBI ; seal ; traditional 亞 . Originally showing floor plan of pit dwelling in ancient China with entrances on the four sides, each linked to a separate room/space (in northern China, according to Mizukami).

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Limited use. Has 扌 34 hand, with 矣 , orig meaning unclear (Tōdō suggests may be original way of writing 疑 848 ‘doubt’) but borrowed in early Chinese to represent a grammatical function word. 矣 is treated in Shuowen as having a phonetic function in 挨 , giving overall sense ‘hit on back, strike from behind’. Use of 挨 in 挨拶 ‘greeting’ is loan usage, only in Japanese; in modern Chinese, core meaning of 挨 is ‘suffer’. TA1965:135-7; SS1984:7; DJ2009:v3:998. Take ム as nose and 矢 145 as ‘arrow’.

Note: Original meaning of 宛 is taken by Ogawa as ‘hemispherical roof’, but by Tōdō as referring to a person bending over. Present meanings are loan usages. OT1968:273; TA1965:611-21; MS1995:v1:290-91; KJ1970:92. Suggest take as slumped/sleepy person.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form shows 火 8 ‘fire’ as lower element, and 寸 920 ‘hand/pulse’, combining with third element (represented by first few strokes of the modern graph) taken either as phonetic with associated sense ‘press down’ (Katō, Ogawa), or semantically as ‘buttocks, posterior’, but again giving rise to the meaning ‘press down’, in the latter analysis as an extended sense (Tōdō). Overall, the graph has the original meaning ‘iron’ (the hand-held implement; later written 熨 ). Already used in Han dynasty China as the name of a military rank (Qiu: ‘company grade military officer’). The latter sense appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:8-9; OT1968:288; SS1984:19; QX2000:135-6.

  • 辞彙 [JII] - dictionary

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses vary. One takes as originally a pictograph of a hedgehog (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Alternatively, it is seen as abbreviation of NJK 彖 ‘wild boar; hedgehog’, with an abbreviation of 胃 447 (‘stomach’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘round, surround’, giving ‘animal which rolls into a ball’, again giving ‘hedgehog’ (Tōdō). Despite the diversity, scholars agree original meaning of 彙 is ‘hedgehog’; the later sense ‘collect’ is an extended sense, based on the large number of densely-packed spines the animal has, giving an impression of being collected together. OT1968:343; SS1984:21; TA1965:712-9. Suggest using 果 454 for its meaning ‘fruit tree’, with head part on top.

Has 心 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, and 尉 1019 (‘military rank’, but originally meant ‘press down’), taken either as phonetic with associated sense i] ‘become angry’, giving ‘anger pent up in the heart’ (Katō), or ii] ‘press down’, giving ‘calm down the heart/feelings’ (Ogawa). In the former interpretation, ‘console’ is a loan usage. Mizukami looks to list a bronze equivalent. KJ1970:9; OT1968:384; MS1995:v1:522-3.

Has 壷 ‘wine jar (bulbous, narrow neck opening out at rim)’, and 吉 1196 (’auspicious’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘steamy, moldy’, thus ‘wine ferments and jar fills up’ (Yamada, Shirakawa, Ogawa). The sense ‘one’ is a loan usage, though possibly with a semantic component also, according to Qiu. YK1976:58; KJ1970:28-30; QX2000:120,275; SS1984:27-8.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation’, and 次 308 (‘next’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘arrange’ (or ‘stop’), giving ‘arrange plant material (on a roof)’, i.e. ‘thatch’. 次 is regarded as the original way of writing 茨 . Reflecting the trend in script development, from depicting the concrete to representing the abstract, it is believed that 次 was the original way of writing ‘miscanthus’ (and similar plants), after which the graph was borrowed for its sound value to represent ‘next’, with 艹 being added to indicate usage when in the sense ‘miscanthus’. Present meanings now include ‘thorn, bramble’. MS1995:696-7; DJ2009:v1:78; KJ1970:181-2.

All these interpretations are seen to involve a connotation of ‘excess’. Associated senses i] to iii] above give overall meaning ‘water oozes out’, ‘water soaks in’, while iv] gives ‘be heavily addicted to evil ways’; the latter is probably a later meaning, but now main one. KJ1970:64-5; MS1995:v2:756-7; OT1968:583; AS2007:573.

Has 阝 ( 阜 ) 1907 ‘hill, piled-up earth’, and (itself the earliest way of writing 陰 ) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘dark’, giving ‘dark side of a hill’, and hence ‘shade, shadow’. By extension, ‘secret’. In Chinese culture, also denotes the dark, negative principle ( yin ) in contrast to the bright, positive one ( 陽 yang ; see 429). Mizukami lists bronze equivalents also. MS1995:v2:1396-7; OT1968:1068; TA1965:815-23. Suggest take right side as 今 138 ‘now’ and NJK 云 ‘say, tell’ (also ‘cloud’: see 83).

<b>鬱</b>
Reading: UTSU
Meaning: melancholy, gloom, depression
Strokes: 29
Level: L1
Number: 1039

Examples:
  • 鬱病 [UTSUBYŌ] - depression
  • 鬱気 [UKKI] - gloom, melancholy
  • 陰鬱 [IN’UTSU] - cheerless

Etymology: Seal form i] ( 鬱 ) ; seal form ii] ( ) . Both occur as traditional forms. Analyses differ. The elements in 鬱 are: 林 79 ‘forest’, 缶 1141 (originally ‘lidded earthenware pot/jar’, now ‘tin, can’), 冖 ‘cover’, 鬯 ‘wine in vessel with fragrant herb added’, and 彡 115 ‘adorn’ etc. Instead of 林 , form ii] has ‘two hands’. Shuowen defines 鬱 as ‘luxuriant tree growth’, and according to Shirakawa, this referred originally to a special variety of wine with herbs, packed into jars. The Shuowen gives separate treatment to 鬱 and the similarly-shaped form ii]. The two graphs appear to have represented two homophonous words in early Chinese, one meaning ‘dense (forest)’ ( 鬱 ), and the other ‘fragrant herb’ (Schuessler). Shirakawa considers form ii] may have originally referred to a fragrant herb used in scented wine, but that form ii] and 鬱 then came to be used interchangeably. This reflects the view of traditional scholarship ( Kangxi zidian ). Mizukami, who gives what he regards as bronze equivalents for 鬱 and form ii], lists both with substantially overlapping meanings (core meaning: trees and other vegetation growing together in very close proximity), and treats ‘fragrant herb’ as a loan use of form ii]. The above variations in form together with differences in treatment of the component parts make this a challenging graph to analyze. SS1984:40-41; MS1995:v2:1480-83; OT1968:530; TA1965: 707-10; DJ2009:v2:492,418-9; KZ2001:361,378; AS2007:513,592.

Specific senses ‘inlet, bay’ reflect Japanese usage rather than Chinese (flat land near ocean or river). KJ1970:856; OT1968:580.

Examples:

  • 影武者 [kageMUSHA] - warrior’s double

Etymology: Seal ( 景 ) ; 影 itself is not included in Shuowen , but Shirakawa notes it reported as occurring in a Han period stele. Another scholar (Katō) accounts as follows for the addition of 彡 115: originally written 景 494 (‘bright’), comprising 日 66 ‘sun’, with 京 110 (‘capital’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘light’; later, though, 光 129 (‘light’) became associated with the Yang principle (positive, strong, male), and 景 with the Yin principle (overcast, dark, negative, female), and at this point the determinative element 彡 (posited meanings vary considerably: ‘light, adorn’ [Ogawa], ‘feathery’ ([Qiu]) was added. The possibility of a semantic association of ‘shadow’ with ‘light’ (shadow cast by light on an object) is noted by Schuessler. SS1984:46; KJ1970:83; AS2007:576-7. Suggest taking 彡 as streams of rays of sunlight, and 景 as ‘sun’ 日 66 over ‘capital’ 京 110.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 兌 (NJK ‘shaman’ 553) as right-hand element. Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 兌 (analyses include ‘open mouth with laughter, glad’ [Gu, Schuessler,], and ‘one who pleases the deities’ [Ogawa], ‘shaman’ [Katō]) as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘sharp, small and sharp’, giving ‘sharp edged tool/item’ (Ogawa, Katō), or – originally – ‘beard of wheat’ (Gu). The latter analysis gives ‘sharp’ as an extended sense, deriving from the fact that a beard of wheat is the bristly material surrounding the kernel, and also reminding us that the ancients were so much more closely in touch with nature than we are today. GY2008:491,1443; AS2007:219,586; OT1968:1043; KJ1970:602-4. Suggest 兄 as ‘elder brother’ 114, 丷 as ‘away’ 70, and 金 as ‘money’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 曷 on right. Has 言 118 ‘speak’, and 曷 (NJK 曰 ‘say, articulate’, with 匃 CO ‘stop and ask’, as phonetic having associated sense ‘stop, detain’), thus ‘stop and question’ (Ogawa); or ‘question loudly’ (Gu), thus ‘request’. Katō accounts for the sense ‘audience, meeting with someone of high status’ by noting that when seeking an audience, a request involved writing down the name of the audience-seeker, which was then presented to the person of high status, and this gave rise to ‘audience’ by association. MS1995:v1:148-9; GY2008:1336; KJ1970:97; OT1968:933. Note 匂 here is not ‘smell’ 1821, though same shape. Take 曰 / 日 as ‘day’ 66, 匕 as sitting person, and 勹 corner.

Note: meanings of 夗 / 夘 are ‘bend the body over’ (Katō), and ‘bend over/fall down’ (the latter is noted in Mizukami as an extended meaning).

  • 煙草 [tabako*] - tobacco

Etymology: OBI ( 垔 ) ; seal . Has 火 8 ‘fire’, and CO 垔 (originally ‘block’). OBI shows smoke from incense burner, taken by Ogawa as ‘produce smoke’; Mizukami takes as ‘smoke from incense burner covers and obscures things’, though the latter seems speculative. Seal form is taken as 火 ‘fire’, with 垔 as phonetic with associated sense ‘obstruct’, construed as ‘fire burns but air flow is blocked and fire smoulders’. Tōdō takes associated sense instead as ‘obscure, conceal’. In all of the above, ‘smoke’ represents a derived sense. OT1968:623; MS1995:v2:804-5; KJ1970:107.

Etymology: Seal ( 蝯 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The 6 th century Yupian gives 猨 as the orthodox form (main form) of this graph, and notes 猿 as a popular form. Later 猿 prevailed and is listed as the main form in Kangxi zidian . It has 犭 , the left-hand form of 犬 ‘dog’ 19 in compound graphs, but often used in a wider sense as ‘animal’, as here. In earlier form 猨 , 爰 1053 is both semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘pull, pull up’, thus ‘animal which pulls itself up (in trees), i.e. ‘monkey’. 袁 84 (‘long/flowing garment’) seems to have replaced 爰 purely for its phonetic function here. DY2009:v3:1098; ZY2009:v2:718; SS1984:59; OT1968:901.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and / 832 (‘cave/hole from which water gushes forth’) as phonetic with associated sense taken variously by scholars. Ogawa sees it as ‘black tinged with blue’. Katō sees it as ‘white’, maintaining that in ancient times lead and tin (the latter a whitish alloy) were not well distinguished, thus the association between lead and white. However, Shuowen itself defines ‘lead’ and ‘tin’ contrastively, explaining 鉛 ‘lead’ as ‘a blue metal’, and NJK 錫 ‘tin’ as ‘a metal between silver and lead’. OT1968:1038; KJ1970:106; DJ2009:v3:1140-41. Take as ‘out’ 八 70 and ‘holes’ 口 22.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 歐 . Has 欠 496, ‘open mouth, yawn; lack, be missing’ (‘bend over’ is another meaning’), with 區 282 (‘divide things up small’, small’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘vomit, disgorge’, giving ‘open mouth and vomit’ (Katō, Ogawa). Alternatively, Tōdō takes 欠 as ‘bend over’, giving ‘bend over and vomit’. In the early modern period, 歐 was employed for its sound value and despite – or because of – its negative sense (quite possibly a carry-over from the Edo period, or from earlier Chinese orthographic usage) to write 歐羅巴 Yōroppa ‘Europe’, a practice which has provided the basis for using 欧 today as a convenient one-graph writing in SJ compounds, meaning ‘Europe’. Modern form simplifies 區 to 区 , as in 282 (ward, section). MS1995:v1:700-1; OT1968:545; KJ1970:3.

However, Shirakawa also notes that 翁 seems to have been used as a loan graph for ‘old man’ from Han times, echoed by Schuessler (‘old man; father’), who also links it to another near-homophone in early Chinese meaning ‘male of older generation, higher rank to whom respect is due’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 宀 30 ‘roof, building’, and ( 釆 ’scatter seed’ over 廾 ‘two hands’), which has various interpretations. Katō takes it as phonetic with associated sense ‘warm under a covered interior’, but Tōdō rejects this approach, arguing it is semantic in function (‘scatter rice grains’), here meaning ‘things are stored under cover’. Shirakawa’s analysis is ‘place (under a roof) to offer up meat’. KJ1970:113; TA1965:227-30; SS1984:67. ‘Inside’ is now the main meaning. Take as 米 220 ‘rice’ under big roof, and 大 56 as ‘big’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and NJK 奄 (‘cover’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Shirakawa suggests that the graph may represent what was originally a loanword from the northern regions. Mizukami analyzes 奄 based on bronze and seal forms as comprising 大 56 ‘big’ (but here meaning ‘cover from above’), with 申 338 ‘say’, here meaning ‘grow upwards’, giving ‘cover from above something growingupwards’.

Etymology: Seal ; in later Shuowen version; traditional 穩 . Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ with (‘be sad/respectful when ritualistically hiding a deity’; see below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in ways which include i] ‘strike/trample, and collect’, giving ‘collect grain ears’ (Ogawa, Katō), and ii] ‘conceal’, giving ‘conceal collected grain (so as not to be prominent)’ (Tōdō). However, Shirakawa asserts there are no actual examples of usage of 穩 in the sense ‘trample and collect grain’, and rather the sense is always ‘quiet, tranquil’. In consequence, Shirakawa interprets the seal form of as two hands positioned beside (one above, one below) a receptacle used in a ritual to conceal a deity, beneath which 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ is positioned as semantic, giving ‘be respectful/sad’. In analyses i] and ii], ‘gentle’ is treated as a loan usage, while Shirakawa takes it as an extended sense. KJ1970:61-2; OT1968:737; TA1965:699-701; SS1984:69,34.

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Originally pictograph of vegetation growing luxuriantly, meaning ‘blossoms of plants/trees’.

Qiu says element is a corrupted form of that appeared from clerical script onwards. Qiu also says that 花 9 ‘flower, blossom’ evolved through substitution based on its sound value of 化 258 ‘change’ for in the graph 華 .

  • 再嫁 [SAIKA] - remarriage

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 女 37 ‘woman’, and 家 89 ‘house, family’; 家 is taken here as i] semantic and phonetic, giving ‘a woman gains a house/family to settle down in’ (Ogawa), or as ii] phonetic with associated sense ‘dressed up’, giving ‘woman who is dressed up’ (Katō), in either case giving ‘bride, go as a bride’. Tōdō includes 嫁 in a word-family meaning ‘cover something underneath’; this may be taken as in broad agreement with Katō’s analysis of the phonetic. Tōdō also regards 嫁 as representing a word probably derived from that underlying 家 , a view which is supported by Schuessler. OT1968:261; KJ1970:125; TA1965:381-3; AS2007:300-01.

Level: L2
Number: 1085

Examples:
  • 製靴 [SEIKA] - shoemaking
  • 靴下 [kutsushita] - sock
  • 長靴 [nagagutsu] - boot

Etymology: Seal ( 鞾 ) (included in a later version of Shuowen ); 靴 is a later version. 鞾 consists of 革 836 ‘leather’, and 華 1079 (originally, vegetation growing luxuriantly) as phonetic, to represent a foreign loanword into Chinese (Ogawa suggests from the language of the Xiongnu) which itself initially denoted long riding boots. In the graph 鞾 , the phonetic function of the right-hand element was later taken over by 化 258 ‘change’, quite possibly with a semantic connotation also. In Japanese usage at least, the sense became more generalized to ‘shoes, footwear’. OT1968:1094; GY2008:1545; SS1984:79.

Etymology: Seal ( 蟁 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form has ‘insect’ (general term), and 民 619 (‘people’) as phonetic purely for its onomatopoeic value to represent the sound of a mosquito buzzing in flight, and on the same basis 民 was later replaced by 文 72 ‘text’ with the double insect reduced to one, 虫 60. Several other variant shapes were also used historically, but need not concern us here. OT1968:885; SS1984:759; GY2008:1048-9.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally a pictograph; the simple shape is interpreted as a curved earthenware container or utensil, or a curved roof tile. ‘(Roof) tile’ tends to be taken as extended sense (Ogawa, Schuessler), though Shirakawa treats this as orig. meaning. Also used for ‘gram’ (in Japanese only). OT1968:663; TA1965:618; AS2007:222-3; SS1984:82.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 隹 324 ‘short-tailed bird, bird’, and 牙 1090 (‘tusk, interlocking pieces’ [here, five strokes]) as phonetic – purely onomatopoeic – denoting ‘crow, mountain crow’. 牙 stands to represent the characteristic cawing sound made by such birds. As Gu suggests, 雅 is no doubt a variant way of writing NJK 鴉 ‘crow’. At a later stage, 雅 was borrowed for its sound value to write another word meaning ‘elegant, refined’, now its main meaning.

Note that 圣 consists of 又 2003 ‘hand’, with 土 64 ‘earth/dirt’, giving ‘person digging’, thus ‘cultivate land, make efforts’. KJ1970:319; OT1968:363; MS1995:v1:262-3.

Etymology: Seal forms , ; late graph ( Shuowen ). While both these seal forms are listed in Shuowen , it is 凷 that is accorded main heading status, with 塊 just noted as another equivalent shape. 凷 consists of 土 64 ‘earth’, and 凵 , which is originally a pictograph of a container, and this would give ‘basket for holding earth’, but one commentator takes 凵 here as having a phonetic role only (Katō). Alternatively, there may be the possibility that the earth in the basket was often made up of clods, giving ‘clod(s) of earth’ as an extended sense. As for 塊 , this consists of 土 , with 鬼 1179 (‘demon’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘round, round and hard’, giving ‘earth which is round (/ and hard)’ (Tōdō, Katō), or ii] ‘big’, giving ‘big earth [chunks]’ (Shirakawa).

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 皆 1099 (‘all, everyone’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘harmony, order’ (Shirakawa). Originally referred to a type of tree, similar to a cypress; a tree which grew straight, reflected in the fact it produced wood suited to construction and the manufacture of wooden artefacts (Gu). Extended meanings include ‘straight, upright’ (figurative sense), and ‘model, rule’. It is this sense ‘model’ which was utilized to refer to a variety of Chinese script, the developmental stage known in Japanese as 楷書 kaisho , a term which is translated into English variously as ‘model script’, ‘regular script’, ‘block script’, and which is the basis of modern script use in the Chinese cultural sphere and in Japan. For more on kaisho , see Introduction. SS1984:93; GY2008:1558; OT1968:513; QX2000:147-8.

Note: CO 褱 has 衣 444 ‘garment/clothes’, with second element (middle part of 褱 ) which is taken either i] as meaning ‘shed tears’, thus ‘shed tears and conceal in one’s clothing’, or ii] as phonetic with associated sense ‘keep, retain’, thus ‘keep (something) within one’s clothing’, and by extension ‘conceal in one’s bosom’ or ‘ embrace’; both analyses are listed by Mizukami. MS1995:v1:280-81,v2:1170-71; KJ1970:322; OT1968:226; SS1984:95. Take as 十 35 ‘ten’, and 目 76 ‘eye’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ).

TA1965:504-08; OT1968:304,149. Suggest taking 圭 as ‘double’ the ground 土 64 with 厂 as cliff.

In the latter analysis, ‘lament’ is presumably to be seen as a loan usage. OT1968:383,458; TA1965:702-06; KJ1970:153.

Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, with 既 / 旣 1177 (originally, ‘eat completely, eat one’s fill’; now ‘already’,) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rub/rub across, make level’, giving ‘length of wood for levelling off’, used for removing excess from top of container for measuring rice (or similar). This was an approximate measure, not precise, so it acquired the extended sense ‘generally, in broad measure’. OT1968:518; KJ1970:152-3; TA1965:706.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 骨 877 ‘bones’ and 亥 875, a graph typically taken as ‘wild animal (probably pig or boar)’. Shirakawa interprets as its carcasse. It came to denote a skeleton or bones in general, not just of a wild animal. Schuessler suggests a possible link between the word represented by 骸 and that represented by 核 1116 ‘nucleus, core’. OT1968:1132; SS1984:102; AS2007:270. Suggest taking 亥 as broken threads 糸 29.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 亥 875 (‘wild animal’ [probably a pig or boar]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘enclose’, giving – in one analysis – ‘box/crate made of wood/tree bark’; later borrowed for ‘stone, kernel’. Another interpretation, found in Erya , a very early Chinese encyclopaedic dictionary, takes it as hard casings on a tree, i.e. treats the original meaning as ‘stone (of peach, etc.), kernel’. OT1968:502; KJ1970:143-4; TA1965:132. We suggest taking 亥 as ‘broken/snapped threads’ 糸 29.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 邑 376 ‘inhabited place, village’ in its common form 阝 as right-hand element, and 享 1218 ‘receive, keep’ in its original sense ‘fortified city walls’. 享 in the sense ‘fortified city walls’ is taken as an abbreviation of a more complex older graph (Katō, Qiu). Overall resultant meaning is ‘enclosed fortified area’ (included in Tōdō’s word-family ‘framework/enclose with a framework’), generalized to ‘enclosure, quarters’. QX2000:129; DJ2009:v2:528-9; TA1965:407-09; OT1968:37; KJ1970:280-81; MS1995:v2:1314-6; SS1984:105. Take 享 as 子 27 ‘child’, cover 亠 , and entrance 口 22.

Etymology: Seal ( 挂 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

The alternative element NJK 卦 (‘indicate response of the gods through divination’) as phonetic has associated sense ‘link up’ (Katō). KJ1970:323,137-8; OT1968:417; DJ2009:v3:1001; SS1984:77.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 舌 755 ‘tongue’, but note that 舌 is a later regularized shape for what at the seal script stage was something different, interpreted by Katō and Tōdō as meaning ‘close the mouth’. The element just described, functioning here as semantic and phonetic (with sense generalized to ‘close’) then combines with 手 to give ‘close with the hands’, and hence ‘fasten, bind’.

The additional Japanese meaning ‘scold, rebuke’ may be seen as an extended meaning. GY2008:1336; DJ2009: v1:119. As with 1048, we suggest taking the top 10 right hand part 曰/日 as ‘day’ 66, 匕 as slumped/sitting person, with 勹 as corner.

Alternatively, there is another variation on interpretation of the phonetic, i.e. iii] ‘revolve, go round’, taken as ‘go round smoothly’, and hence again ‘smooth’ (Ogawa).

The meaning ‘brown’ is an extended sense based on the color of such garments. GY2008:1766; SS1984:115; OT1968:907.

  • こう且 [KŌSHO] - for a while

Etymology: OBI ; bronze ; seal . Considered to be based on a pictograph, but interpretations vary regarding exactly what is depicted. One view takes as meat in a tiered vessel, as an offering (Ogawa); another takes as tomb with multiple layers of earth piled up in a mound (Katō). Alternatively, 且 is seen by others as layers of meat on a chopping-board (or stand), as the original way of writing NJK 俎 ‘chopping-board’ (Shirakawa, Tōdō, Gu). Given the shape of many of the OBI forms (Mizukami gives several dozen), however, yet another interpretation deserves serious consideration, i.e. that the graph originally depicted a phallus, and by extension was used for what was later written 祖 758 ‘ancestor’ (Gu, Karlgren). Originally a picto-graph, 且 was borrowed at an early stage as a convenient way of writing several other words or grammatical elements with more abstract senses, including ‘moreover’, hence its meaning in Japanese today. KJ1970:640; OT1968:18; SS1984:428; TA1965:364-5; GY2008:158; BK1957:31-2; AS2007:306.

  • 汗顔 [KANGAN] - shame
  • 汗水 [asemizu] - heavy sweat

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 干 840 (‘weapon; dry’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘come out to excess, pour out all over the place’, giving ‘sweat’. It does seem somewhat ironic to have a character normally meaning ‘dry’ to express ‘pour out’, and it may be better to think of it in its earlier meaning as ‘weapon’. KJ1970:203; OT1968:557; SS1984:117.

Number: 1142

Examples:
  • 肝臓 [KANZŌ] - liver
  • 肝心 [KANJIN na] - vital, essential
  • 肝っ玉 [kimottama] - ‘guts’, courage

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 干 840 (‘dry’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘base, foundation’ (Ogawa), giving ‘bodily part which is essential’; Shirakawa seems to support this interpretation. Katō, alternatively, looks to take the associated sense as ‘dwarf bamboo’, on the basis of the tubular shape of the blood vessels linked to the liver, giving ‘bodily part with blood vessels shaped like dwarf bamboo stems’. In the former analysis, the meaning is perhaps somewhat vague. OT1968:816; SS1984:118; KJ1970:204.

  • 冠毛 [KANMŌ] - crest, plume

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Typically analyzed as 冖 ‘cover, and 寸 920 ‘hand, measure’, and 元 117 (‘origin, source’) as semantic and phonetic in its original sense ‘head’, giving ‘put on a cap’, and by extension ‘cap’; Katō has a view that differs somewhat, taking the associated sense of 元 here as ‘tie/bind the hair’, though he arrives at essentially the same overall meaning for the graph. TA1965:619; OT1968:101; SS1984:119; KJ1970:330.

Examples:
  • 陥没 [KANBOTSU] - cave-in
  • 欠陥 [KEKKAN] - defect
  • 陥落 [KANRAKU] - surrender

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 陷 . The OBI form of CO 臽 has the figure of a person over a hole, meaning ‘pit, hole’; and at the seal stage 阜/阝 1907 ‘hill, terraced slope’ was added on the left side, giving overall sense ‘elevated land caves in’ (Ogawa), or ‘get trapped, fall in’ (Schuessler). DJ2009:v3:1185; OT1968:1067; AS2007:530. A separate vertical stroke appears to have found its way into the modern graph, namely 旧 . We suggest taking this as 旧 677 ‘old, past’, and 勹 as person falling.

<b>乾</b>

Meaning: dry
Strokes: 11

Number: 1145

Examples:
  • 乾電池 [KANDENCHI] - dry battery
  • 乾燥機 [KANSŌKI] - (tumble) drier
  • 乾季 [KANKI] - dry season

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations vary considerably. Ogawa takes it simply as a variant of CO 倝 (original meaning ‘sunrise’ [see 幹 667]), which he interprets as ‘flagpole’, a point on which Shirakawa is in basic agreement, though he takes 乙 1072 here as ‘banner’. Gu, alternatively, sees it as showing a plant breaking out upwards through the surface of the ground. Katō does not favour the ‘plant’ interpretation, and instead takes 乙 as meaning ‘twisted, bent’ (though commentators disagree on what precisely 乙 originally represented, there is substantial support for a core meaning ‘curved’; see 1072), and 倝 / (‘sun shines high in the sky’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘strong, which Katō then takes as giving an overall sense ‘something bent straightens out’. Yet another analysis – probably the best – is provided by Tōdō, who takes 乙 as ‘twisting’, and as ‘sun rises up’ (the bronze and seal forms of 倝 / include the element 日 ‘sun’ 66), giving overall sense ‘air rises up in meandering fashion’ for 乾 . As for the meaning ‘dry’ for 乾 , Tōdō sees this as semantically related to his interpretation of the original meaning of that graph; both senses are included in his word-family ‘rise up’. DJ2009:v3:1200; OT1968:28; SS1984:123; GY2008:1198; KJ1970:102-3; MS1995:v1:70-71; TA1965:587; AS2007:249. Suggest taking 乙 as ‘bent’,  as ‘person’, and as ‘sun rising (through plants)’.

Used for ‘inspect, investigate’ at an early period (this sense noted in Yupian ). KJ1970:209; OT1968:128; AS2007:331.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). 心 ‘heart, mind’ 164, with NJK 串 ‘skewer’ (originally, depicting shells [as currency] pierced through middle and arranged on string), taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘be in distress’, giving ‘be troubled, suffer’ (Mizukami, Ogawa), though Tōdō, by contrast, takes literally as ‘pierce the heart’, and regards ‘troubled’ as an extended sense. MS1995:v1:508-10; OT1968:372,22; TA1965:642; BK1957:63-4.

Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and CO 奐 (taken as ‘menstrual soiling’ [Katō], or ‘give birth’ [Shirakawa, Tōdō]) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘wail’, giving ‘wail, shout’ (Katō), or ii] ‘bring together’, giving ‘shout together/collectively’ (Tōdō). MS1995:v1:302; KJ1970:332-333; SS1984:120; TA1965:630,647; OT1968:188. Take 勹 as bent figure, thighs, 大 56 ‘big’, 口 ‘yell’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘ground’, and 甚 1552 (now ‘extreme’, originally ‘sexual relations’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stick out’, giving ‘ground which sticks out’, ‘raised ground’. The later sense ‘endure’ now predominates for this graph, Katō suggesting it is a borrowed meaning based on connection with 勘 1146, the early meaning of which was also ‘endure’. The fact that 堪 and 勘 represented near-homophones in early Chinese supports this view. KJ1970:208-9; MS1995:v2:866-7; AS2007:330-31; OT1968:219.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 奐 1149 (‘menstrual soiling’ [Katō], or ‘give birth’ [Shirakawa, Tōdō]) as phonetic with associated sense either as i] ‘change, exchange’ [Katō], or ii] ‘take out, remove’ (as with a baby at birth; Shirakawa, Tōdō). In latter view ‘exchange’ is presumably loan usage or extended sense (Tōdō considers to be the latter). KJ1970:332-3; SS1984:120,125; TA1965:630. Take 勹 as bent figure, thighs, 大 56 ‘big’.

Examples:
  • 借款 [SHAKKAN] - loan, credit
  • 落款 [RAKKAN] - signature
  • 款待 [KANTAI] - hospitality

Etymology: Seal forms , . This graph has several alternative shapes, mostly involving variation on the left-hand side (e.g. 欵 ), with 欠 496 (initially, pictograph of person with mouth open wide; now meaning ‘lack’). In addition, Gu lists one form that he treats as the OBI predecessor, consisting of left-hand 柰 (NJK, originally‘firewood on altar’, now meaning ‘what?’), with right-hand 又 ‘hand’ 2003, signifying a ritualistic request to the gods to be granted good fortune. Based on the seal forms, several other commentators (Katō, Ogawa) also take the core meaning of this graph/graph group as involving some sort of wish (still a meaning in Chinese). Regarding variation in shape, it is worth observing that Shuowen notes 款 written with 柰 on the left-hand side as an alternative form: it may well be that an original 木 as top left-hand element in one form of this graph later became corrupted to 士 (Ogawa takes this view). Katō analyzes 款 on the basis of the seal form in Shuowen as 欠 in its early sense ‘(mouth) wide open’, with a left-hand element 祟 (NJK ‘curse’, meaning given in Shuowen as ‘calamity initiated by the gods’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pit, cavity, void’, giving ‘what a person longs for’. Through association with ‘cavity, void’, Katō then takes ‘engrave’ (as in the case of inscriptions traditionally on artefacts such as bronze bells and vessels) as an extended sense. Other meanings such as ‘friendship’ and ‘clause’ are perhaps best seen as loan usages. GY2008:1365,1163; KJ1970:305; OT1968:533; DJ2009:v2:704,v1:11; AS2007:338. We suggest taking this awkward graph as 士 521 ‘samurai’, 示 723 ‘show’, and 欠 496 ‘lack’, fortunately having an easier mnemonic.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 門 231 ‘gate’, and 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, giving original sense ‘timber for closing gate, bar on gate’; ‘obstruct’ and ‘defend’ evolved as extended senses. Use of 閑 in the sense ‘leisure’ may have been a loan usage for an early Chinese word of that meaning which was homophonous with the word meaning ‘bar on gate’.

According to Shirakawa, 韓 has always served to denote a proper noun; early use was as name of ancient state in Warring States period China (ca. 403-221BC). ‘South Korea’ is the modern meaning. Note: Shuowen defines meaning of 韓 as ‘(water) well surround’, but Shirakawa sees this as loan usage, and tentatively takes original meaning as ‘ornate halberd with leather grip’. MS1995:v1:70-71; SS1984:132,127; TA1965:587; DJ2009:v2:445. Take 韋 as ‘differ’, as 日 66 ‘sun’ rising through ‘plants’ 艹 .

Number: 1168

Examples:
  • 玩具 [GANGU/omocha*] - a toy
  • 愛玩者 [AIGANSHA] - admirer
  • 玩弄 [GANRŌ suru] - make sport of

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 玉 15 ‘jade, jewel’, and 元 117 (‘origin, source’, initially ‘large head’) as phonetic. Associated sense is taken variously as ‘cup the hands’ (Tōdō), ‘pick up’ (Gu), ‘offer up in the hands’ (Shirakawa), ‘throw (something) down/roll (something) over’ (Ogawa), but the consensus regarding the original core meaning of the graph (except Ogawa) may be summarised as ‘take a piece of jade in the hands’. ‘Appreciate’, which appears to be an early extended sense, is now just a minor sense. It is not clear whether ‘play’ is a loan usage or an extended sense; Gu takes as the latter. TA1965:611-19; SS1984:136; OT1968:655; GY2008:542.

Katō takes graph as round head and ‘stubborn’ as borrowed meaning. SS1984:137; GY2008:983; KJ1985:661.

In broad terms, the modern simplified form may be said to retain the basic profile of the seal version. MS1995:v2:1530-31; MR2007:492; OT1968:1175. We suggest taking the pictograph in its whole modern form as a mnemonic.

Katō, by contrast, takes ‘small’ as the associated phonetic sense of 其 , giving ‘game board pieces’ as the direct (not extended) meaning. See also 碁 1314.

Comprises 亻 41 person, and 爲 1017 (‘do; purpose’), the latter typically taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘change appearance’, giving ‘someone changes appearance/changes into someone else’ (with negative connotation), and hence ‘deceive; false’. Ogawa – perhaps less convincingly – takes 爲 / 為 differently as having a semantic role here, giving ‘person does’, and ‘deceit’ as an extended sense. KJ1970:19; TA1965:607-10; OT1968:73.

  • 犠打 [GIDA] - sacrifice hit (baseball)

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 牛 108 ‘cow, ox’, and 義 674 (later meaning: ‘righteous’), which may be taken as both semantic and phonetic in function; the original meaning of 義 , which includes 我 833 (originally ‘halberd’, now ‘I, self’) is ‘animal sacrifice’. This then leads to an overall sense ‘ox sacrifice’, or more generally ‘animal sacrifice’ for 犠 (Ogawa, Tōdō, Shirakawa). A divergent view is offered by Katō, who maintains that 義 serves here as phonetic only, originally with an associated sense ‘young male (ox)’, which for sacrificial purposes was of a single color, and ‘single color’ subsequently came to predominate as the new associated sense, giving the overall sense ‘young ox of a single color’; in this interpretation, ‘sacrifice’ is an extended sense. SS1984:165; OT1968:639; TA1965:592; KJ1970:241-2.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation’, and CO 匊 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘having shrivelled leaves’, giving ‘plant with shrivelled leaves’ (Katō), or ii] ‘round’, giving ‘plant with round [head/flower]’, i.e. ‘chrysanthemum’ (Ogawa). However, both Katō and Shirakawa maintain that in ancient times this graph did not refer to the chrysanthemum/an autumn-flowering plant; according to Shirakawa, originally it referred instead to a different flowering plant called Wild Pink or Large Pink ( Dianthus superbus ). Note: 匊 comprises 勹 (see 611), a determinative originally depicting the side view of a person bending over with arms lowered, signifying ‘embrace, enclose’, with 米 220 ‘rice’ (here has more the sense ‘scattered grains’), giving ‘enclose within the hand(s), and by extension ‘scoop up’. KJ1970:257; OT1968:858; SS1984:166; MS1995:v1:150-51.

Has 口 22 ‘mouth, say’, and 契 1258 (originally, ‘mark with knife, engrave’; now means ‘pledge, join’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘chew’, to give ‘eat by chewing, eat’; ‘receive’ is an extended minor sense. KJ1970:258; OT1968:188; SS1984:168. We suggest breaking down this graph into 大 56 ‘big’, 口 22 ‘mouth’, 刀 198 ‘sword’, and as variant of 主 315 ‘master’.

Etymology: Seal ( 卻 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally, 卩 41 ‘person kneeling’, with (see Note below; not to be confused with similar-shaped 谷 135 ‘valley’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘retreat, withdraw’, giving original sense ‘withdraw on one’s knees (from presence of a superior)’, then generalized to just ‘withdraw’. Whether by design or in error, left-hand was later replaced by 去 276 ‘go, leave’. ‘On the contrary’ (i.e. the opposite of what might be expected) may be regarded as an extended sense. Note: Katō takes 卻 to mean ‘roof of the mouth’, but Tōdō takes as ‘bend at back of knee’; in either case, refers to an inwardly-curving – i.e. concave – part of the body.

This graph was originally written 鼻 399 ‘nose’, with 臭 1452 ‘smell, odor’, giving overall meaning ‘smell’ (verb), this being based on dogs being well-known for their keen sense of smell. Subsequently (Six Dynasties period [220-589AD] onwards), 口 22 ‘mouth’ was sometimes used as determinative in place of 鼻 , giving 嗅 , which has come to predominate. In standard modern Japanese usage, the semantically transparent component 犬 19 ‘dog’ here has been retained, but note that in 臭 1452 ‘smell, odor’ when used as an independent graph, standard usage still favors the semantically opaque 大 56 ‘big’ as lower element due to earlier script simplification. SS1984:177; GY2008:1082; OT1968:192. We suggest taking the elements as 自 150, which is now used to mean ‘self’ but was originally a nose, with ‘big spotted dog’ 犬 19, plus ‘mouth’ 口 22.

<b>窮</b>

Number: 1208

Examples:
  • 窮極 [KYŪKYOKU] - extremity
  • 窮屈 [KYŪKUTSU] - constraint
  • 窮乏 [KYŪBŌ] - poverty

Etymology: Seal ( 竆 ) . Interpretations diverge. Has 穴 860 ‘cave, hole’, and NJK 躳 ‘body’; at the clerical script stage, we find 躬 as an alternative form (also NJK), and this latter appears to have later gained ascendancy over 躳 . One analysis takes 躳 / 躬 as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend the body over’, giving ‘bend over and enter deep into (a cave)’ (Tōdō, Ogawa); by extension, ‘be in difficulties/an extreme situation’. Katō takes the associated sense of 躬 / 躳 as ‘extreme’, to give ‘innermost part of cave dwelling’. Note: 躳 is 身 339 ‘body’, with NJK 呂 ‘backbone, spine’ (originally pictograph). DJ2009:v2:596; TA1965:225-6; KJ1970:264; GY2008:1084; OT1968:742; SK1984:584. We suggest taking the elements as 穴 860 ‘hole’, and further taking the elements of 躬 into 身 339 (still with a meaning of ‘body’) and 弓 as ‘bow’ 107.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 據 . Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, with CO 豦 as phonetic with associated sense ‘rest on, hold onto’, thus ‘hold onto with the hands’, and by extension ‘rely on’. Note: 豦 is typically interpreted as depicting a tiger ( 虍 1301) and boar or wild pig ( 豕 89) fighting each other. The right-hand part of the modern form is based on a cursive style which is the same shape as 処 (907 ‘deal with’). SS1984:180; TA1965:385; MS1995:v2:1222-4; KJ1970:268; GY2008:1582; ZY2009:v2:435.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 虛 . Has , a minor variation of early form of 丘 1203 ‘hillock’, and 虍 1301 (‘tiger’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘big’, thus ‘big hill’. Based on early forms of 丘 , Tōdō takes to show hillocks around a central depression or basin, thus giving ‘empty’ as extended sense. Ogawa, however, treats ‘empty’ as loan usage. OT1968:881; TA1965:398-400; MS1995:v1:7-8. Suggest as variant of 並 977 ‘line up’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Typically analyzed as 凵 ‘open container, open mouth’, and inner element (seal form) or メ as phonetic with associated sense ‘empty’, giving ‘mouth is empty’, and by extension ‘bad, misfortune’. An alternative interpretation takes 凵 as representing a hole in the ground, and as a person stuck in it, again leading to ‘bad’ as an extended sense (this view noted in Mizukami). OT1968:108; MS1995:v1:120-21; KJ1970:273.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

Tōdō’s view is based on taking the right-hand element as originally corresponding to the same element in 往 652 ‘go’, on which Qiu is in agreement. TA1965:415; OT1968:640; QX2000:253; KJ1970:270-71.

  • 狭苦しい [semakurushii] - cramped

Etymology: Seal ( 陜 ) . 狹 with 犭 19 ‘dog’ is an error for earlier 陜 with 阝 ‘hill, terraced slope’ 1907. Qiu states this occurred at an early stage. 夾 (‘hold under arms’, see 1220) is phonetic with associated sense ‘held between on both sides’, giving ‘blocked on both sides by hills/mountains’; hence, ‘narrow valley’, then generalized to ‘narrow, small’. KJ1970:174; QX2000:267. Take right hand element as ‘man’ 夫 603 and 丷 as ‘away’ 70.

Note: 巩 is 丮 ‘hold out hands’ 905, with 工 125 as phonetic with associated sense ‘embrace’, thus ‘embrace with hands’. KJ1970:277; MS1995:v1:504-6; TA1965:306; OT1968:368; KJ1970:277.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 矢 145 ‘arrow’, and NJK 喬 277 (now ‘high’, originally building with curved upper structure, q.v.) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘curved, bent’, thus ‘bent arrow’, and ‘falsify’ as an extended sense. Since a bent arrow needed straightening to fly true, over time ‘straighten’ evolved as a second extended sense, and this has come to be the main meaning. Note: bronze forms of 喬 consist of 高 132 (‘high’; originally tall structure, such as watchtower), with curved stroke(s) signifying ‘curved’. That is, both mean ‘high’ now. MS1995:v1:236-7; KJ1970:274-5; SS1984:200; TA1965:263. We suggest remembering in association with 橋 277 ‘bridge’.

Shirakawa, however, interprets 敬 as ‘hit to admonish someone making spell-like prayer’, with 馬 added, he suggests, as an animal easily startled. The former view seems more persuasive.

Etymology: Seal ( 卬 ) ; seal ( 仰 ) . Older graph 卬 is analyzed as ‘person kneeling’ 卩 41 in front of someone standing (Mizukami takes as ‘person standing up tall’), giving ‘look up at and greet (an arriving guest)’. Later graph 仰 has additional ‘person’ element ( 亻 41); this is believed not to represent an extra third person, but a way to distinguish it from another similar character ( 迎 1273 ‘greet’).

Has 日 66 ‘sun’, with CO 堯 (‘tall person’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘become bright, white’, giving ‘light of the sun becomes clear’, i.e. ‘dawn’. 堯 may well also lend a semantic element in the idea of tall, indicating rising high. Dawn is also an event. Note: 堯 consists of 垚 ‘earth piled up high’, with 兀 ‘person with head above others’, giving ‘tall person’, and by extension ‘outstanding person’. OT1968:470; KJ1970:282; TA1965:266; MS1995:v1:274-5. See also 焼 539 ‘burn’, which we suggest taking by association to remember 1230.

At the clerical script stage, the lower element 人 changed to 今 138 (‘now’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘enclose in box shape, enclose’, thus ‘box-shape musical instrument with strings’, i.e. koto . Ogawa, however, takes associated sense to be ‘sound’. Mizukami and Ogawa take the keyhole-shaped element in seal form, corresponding to 人 in 琴 as abbreviation of later 今 , as phonetic. MS1995:v2:854-5; KJ1970:243; SS1984:210; OT1968:658. Take 王 as ‘king’ 5.

Examples:
  • 唐錦 [Kara nishiki] - Chinese brocade

  • 錦絵 [nishikiE] - colored print

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has NJK 帛 ‘white silk, silk cloth’, with 金 16 ‘gold’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘silk fabric with gold color’. Tōdō, following an explanation in the Shiming dictionary of ca. 200AD, treats 錦 as indicating this type of fabric is the most valuable, just as 金 ‘gold’ is the most valuable metal. ‘Brocade’, a cloth which does not necessarily use silk, is extended sense. Note: 帛 comprises 巾 1232 ‘cloth fragment, cloth’, with 白 69 ‘white’. GY2008:1609; OT1968:320,315; MS1995:v1:438-9; TA1965:822.

Examples:
  • 吟詠 [GIN’EI] - recital

  • 吟遊詩人 [GIN’YŪSHIJIN] - minstrel

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 口 22 ‘mouth’, and 今 138 (‘now’) as phonetic, the latter typically interpreted as ‘close, shut’, thus giving ‘close mouth and moan’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa) or ‘moan’ (Katō). However, moaning is normally emitted with the mouth open, a point which brings this interpretation of the meaning into question. On the basis of usage in early texts, Qiu interprets the original meaning of 吟 as ‘close the mouth and remain silent’; if this is accepted, senses such as ‘moan, sing, recite’ need to be regarded as loan usages. OT1968:170; SS1984:214; KJ1970:176; QX2000.

  • 危惧の念 [KIGU no NEN] - apprehension

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 懼 . Has 忄 164 ‘heart/mind’ and 瞿 (orig ‘bird looks round nervously’; see Note below). 瞿 is taken as semantic and phonetic (Ogawa, Gu) or just phonetic with associated sense ‘look round nervously’ (Mizukami, Shirakawa), both cases giving same overall sense ‘be afraid’. 惧 is a later popular form. Note: 瞿 has ‘look left and right’, with 隹 324 ‘short-tailed bird’, thus ‘bird looks round nervously’ (Shirakawa). Qiu prefers ‘eagle’s gaze’. MS1995:v1:530-31; SS1984:218; GY2008:1328; OT1968:392; QX2000:197; DJ2009:v3:850. Suggest 具 as 目 76 ‘eye’ with ‘hands’ / .

Shuowen defines as ‘[image of] person made of paulownia wood’. ‘Even number’ may be seen as extended sense based on two (original and likeness): likewise ‘spouse’. Shirakawa also takes 偶 as ‘doll, image made as likeness’, but links original sense back to 禺 , taking as initially showing effigy in shape of deity with large head. DJ2009:v2:663; OT1968:73; KJ1970:298; SS1984:220; GY2008:1100. Use 禺 as leggy insect in ‘field’ 田 63.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 hand, and 屈 1249 (‘crouch’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘scoop up’, thus ‘dig out, dig’. Katō, however, takes associated sense as ‘turn soil with plow’, thus ‘turn soil by hand and make hole’. 掘 is given in Shuowen as ‘dig out’; for the similar-shaped graph 堀 1990 (‘ditch’), Shuowen gives meaning ‘rabbit digs/rabbit warren’. Some early texts seem to show interchangeability or confusion of usage between 掘 and 堀 . OT1968:417; TA1965:707-10; AS2007:337; KJ1970:304-5.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Yupian ). Later (post-seal) form replaces 土 64 ‘earth, ground’ with 穴 860 ‘hole, cave’, and 屈 1249 (‘bend, crouch’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘dig’ (Ogawa); Schuessler, though, gives first meaning for 窟 as ‘dig in the ground, underground’. Tōdō, for his part, takes this graph as signifying ‘cave/hole hollowed out in a round shape’. Perhaps best taken as ‘that which has been dug out’ (whether by human endeavor or forces of nature). OT1968:742; AS2007:337; TA1965:710; GY2008:1665. Note: 窟 is grouped together with 堀 (‘moat, ditch, canal’ 1990) by Gu and Schuessler.

Tōdō takes extended sense as ‘draw from surface’, thus ‘draw off thread from cocoon surface’. Note: 喿 has three mouths 品 22, i.e. ‘many mouths’, with 木 73 ‘tree’, giving ‘birds settle and sing noisily in tree’, then generalized to ‘noisy’. OT1968:793; SS1984:550; TA1965:258-60; MS1995:v1:242-3. Suggest 喿 as three wooden boxes.

Has 力 78 ‘strength/effort’, and NJK 熏 (‘smolder’; orig signified bouquet of fragrant herbs smoldering over fire 灬 8 [Ogawa], or smoke rising through upper vent [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘much/many’ (Katō), or ii] ‘hang heavy’, i.e. be in abundance (Tōdō explains this as being as if human endeavor were to ‘hang heavy’ like incense-laden smoke emanating from a bouquet of fragrant herbs); either analysis gives same overall sense of ‘much effort’. Ogawa treats 熏 as serving not as semantic in the graph 勲 but as phonetic with associated sense ‘gather’ or ‘serve’, which he takes as giving the overall sense ‘merit in govt, merit’. KJ1970:344; TA1965:625,723-5; OT1968:130; MS1995:v2:806-8. Take 重 as 326 ‘heavy’.

Examples:
  • 渓谷 [KEIKOKU] - valley, gorge

  • 渓流 [KEIRYŪ] - mountain stream

Etymology: Seal ( 谿 ) ; a late post- Shuowen graph; traditional 溪 . Traditional form has 氵 42 ‘water’, with 奚 (originally, ‘bound slave’: see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘caught, entangled’, taken in one view as giving ‘mountain stream with (seemingly) no way out’, and by extension ‘twisting and turning mountain stream’ (Ogawa). Gu, in contrast, takes ‘mountain valley/gully’ as the original meaning, and ‘mountain stream’ as an extended sense on the basis that most such gullies have water running through them. The seal form (CO 谿 ) ‘valley; mountain stream’ is treated separately from 渓 in Shuowen , but Kangxi zidian treats both as being the same. Note: 奚 is made up of 爫 1739 ‘claw’ – sometimes, as here, ‘hand’ – with 幺 29 ‘thread’ (here, ‘rope’), with 大 56 ‘big’ (here, ‘person’), giving ‘person bound with rope’, i.e. ‘(one type of) slave’ (Gu). OT1968:585; GY2008:1656,1091; QX2000:264; MS1995:v1:304-05; AS2007:526. We suggest taking 夫 as ‘man’ 601.

Examples:
  • 傾向 [KEIKŌ] - tendency
  • 傾倒 [KEITŌ] - devotion
  • 傾斜度 [KEISHADO] - gradient

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally written 頃 (see Note below), with 頁 103 ‘head’, and 匕 (originally, pictograph of person with bent, withered leg; by extension, ‘bent’) as semantic and phonetic, usually taken as giving ‘incline the head’; later generalized to ‘incline/lean’. By seal stage, when 頃 was also being borrowed to represent several other words, ‘person’ 亻 41 was added to more clearly indicate ‘lean/incline’, thus 傾 . ‘Dedication’ is minor extended sense. Note 1: 頃 is now used to write koro ‘time, period’; see 1356. Note 2: 匕 is taken by Mizukami and Katō as originally showing a bent, withered leg, and based on shape by extension ‘ladle’. Ogawa, though, takes ‘ladle’ as orig. meaning, and Gu takes as ‘woman kneeling submissively’, while Katō considers 匕 in 傾 / 頃 as having only a phonetic role with associated sense ‘not straight’, and by extension ‘lame’, and that the Shuowen explanation should be seen as ‘head’ representing ‘body’, thus giving ‘bent body’, but this seems debatable. See also Appendix for 匕 contrasting with 匕 (‘change’). TA1965:504-9; GY2008:602,1074,11; MS1995:v1:154-5; OT1968:77,132; KJ1970:357,796; AS2007:432.

Examples:
  • 携帯 [KEITAI-] - portable

  • 提携 [TEIKEI] - cooperation, link

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 攜 . Has 扌 34 ‘hand’ and 雟 (type of bird; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘let hang down’ (Ogawa says ‘link, keep [on rope’ etc.]’), thus ‘hang down from/carry in the hands’. 携 , a popular historical abbreviated form of 雟 , now has official status. Note: 雟 is treated by Katō as made by 隹 324 ‘bird’, with top element taken not as 山 26 ‘mountain/hill’ but as similar-shaped 屮 , representing cranial feathers (not 屮 as ‘sprouting plant’); the lower element 冏 represents a graphic merging of what in earlier stages of the script was written two different ways, one being a pictograph of a window, the other seen as buttocks and anus/vagina. In the graph 雟 under discussion here, Katō takes 冏 as representing, basically, buttocks and anus (see 333), and by extension – with regard to a bird – as ‘tail-end’, with tail feathers fanning out (noting the 儿 shape in 冏 ), thus ‘swallow’; Ogawa also takes as ‘swallow’. ‘Participate’ derives from having one’s hands occupied, suggesting getting involved. MS1995:v1:254-5,234-5; KJ1970:349-50; TA1965:504-8; OT1968:425,1081. Take 乃 as plump buttocks.

Etymology: Bronze ; seal ; traditional 繼 . Originally written . Bronze form shows several short lengths of thread (or skeins), with other components, which some scholars make no comment on. These other components are as follows: i] a horizontal line midway, and ii] two short lines bottom right. Katō takes i] to signify joined threads, and seems to take ii] to show repetition. Shirakawa, however, takes (facing right, as here) as ‘cut threads’, as does Gu. Seal form likewise has 糸 29 ‘thread’ added as determinative, giving ‘join threads’. By extension ‘follow, patch, inherit’. MS1995:v2:1026-7; KJ1970:346; OT1968:779; SS1984:236; GY2008:1173,1311. Take as 米 220 ‘rice’ in corner.

In Japanese, more used in sense ‘visit a shrine/temple’. GY2008:737-8,303,11; SS1984:236; KJ1970:796. Take 匕 as sitting person, 日 as ‘day’ 66.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind’, and 景 494 (‘scene’; ‘bright’) as phonetic. Difficult to analyze, and scholars seem to avoid it. Shuowen gives meaning as ‘perceive, be aware’, but Shirakawa maintains there are no examples of use in this sense in early texts, only in the sense ‘be far away’ (Schuessler). Basis for ‘adore, yearn’ (Japanese only) is unclear. 憬 occurs in only one compound, as above. GY2008:1846; SS1984:239; OT1968:387. Suggest taking 景 literally as 日 66 ‘sun’ and 京 110 ‘capital’.

<b>稽</b>
Reading: KIN
Meaning: consider, stop, reach, bow low
Strokes: 15
Level: L1
Number: 1270

Examples:
  • 稽古 [KEIKO] - training, practice
  • 下稽古 [shitaGEIKO] - rehearsal
  • 滑稽 [KOKKEI na] - comical

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations vary, and can become quite confusing. One interpretation takes the graph as 𥝌 ‘tree with tip bent over’, with NJK 耆 (‘grow old, senility’; in this analysis, the element 尤 (orig. ‘blame’) in 稽 is regarded as a miscopying of the element 耂 [an abbreviation of 老 ‘grow old’ 638]) as a phonetic likewise with an associated sense ‘tree with tip bent over’, giving ‘tree with tip bent over’ (Katō); ‘consider’ is presumably to be treated as a loan usage. There are several other analyses. One of these looks to analyze 稽 as 尤 , with CO as phonetic with associated sense ‘be caught/entangled’, giving ‘detain’ (Ogawa). In this analysis, ‘plan, consider’ is again presumably loan usage. Alternatively, a ritualistic meaning is attributed by Shirakawa to 稽 , based on an interpretation as 𥝌 ‘tree with tip bent over’, with 尤 taken as ‘dog sacrifice’ (Shirakawa takes OBI form of 尤 as depicting an [unspecified] type of animal, presumably dog 犬 19), and 旨 1401 ‘gist, tasty’ as the original writing for 詣 1267 ‘respectfully visit’; Shirakawa then takes the overall original meaning of 稽 as ‘dog sacrifice ritual’, with the deity who is revered believed to come down to the venue of the ritual, thereby giving ‘reach’ as an extended sense. Presumably, by this explanation, ‘bow low’ is an extended sense too, and possibly also related to the ritual, along with ‘consideration’. At some point the tree with the tip bending right (whereas the regular way for the grain plant determinative 禾 is sloping down further to left) acquired the regular slope to the left. KJ1970:356-7; OT1968:736; MS1995:v1:402-3; SS1984:239-40,832. We suggest taking 禾 87 as ‘grain plant’, 尤 as 犬 19 ‘dog’ with bent leg, 匕 as man sitting, and 日 as ‘sun’ 66.

<b>憩</b>

Number: 1271

Examples:
  • 休憩 [KYŪKEI] - rest, recess
  • 少憩 [SHŌKEI] - brief rest
  • 憩い [ikoi] - rest, ‘spell’

Etymology: Seal ; a late, post- Shuowen graph. Has 息 351 ‘rest, repose’, and 舌 , which here appears to have been originally not 舌 755 ‘tongue’, but an element 𠯑 (CO; ‘close the mouth; by extension, ‘prevent’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, giving ‘stop and rest’. The explanation regarding substitution of 舌 for 𠯑 appears to be that confusion arose at the graphic level between the two at an early juncture (possibly pre-seal stage); variant forms for these two which are roughly similar in shape are considered to exist (Gu, Mizukami). Another commentator gives a different analysis, taking 憩 as 息 ‘rest, repose’, with 舌 as the phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, thus likewise giving ‘stop and rest’ as the overall meaning (Ogawa). Note: 𠯑 , which in one view serves here just as phonetic, itself comprises 口 22 ‘mouth’, with not 氏 522, but a different element (meaning knife for carving) as phonetic with associated sense ‘close, block’, hence ‘close the mouth’ (Mizukami). KJ1970:358; MS1995:v1:216-7,v2:724-5,1096-7; OT1968:387. We suggest taking 舌 as ‘tongue’, and also break down 息 into components 自 150 ‘self/nose’, and 心 164 ‘heart’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 擊 . One view has 手 34 ‘hand’, and 毄 (‘carriage axle grates in its housing’) or its variant form 𣪠 as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit, strike’, giving overall meaning ‘hit, strike’ (Gu, Katō). Tōdō, alternatively, takes 𣪠 as having a semantic role (‘wheel hits against axle securing-pin’), combining with 手 to give ‘hit with hand’, a view shared by Ogawa. Note: the above meaning for 毄 is based on Katō’s analysis; the 口 shape beneath 車 33 ‘vehicle’ represents the housing for the axle, and 殳 170 ‘strike’ signifies the friction between axle and housing.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 車 33 ‘vehicle’, and 干 840 (originally, type of forked weapon; now ‘dry’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘stick out, project’, giving ‘cart/carriage with projecting shafts’, with the semantic range being extended to other things which project, such as eaves (Ogawa). Another analysis treats 干 as phonetic with associated sense ‘put/rise high up’, giving carriage shafts which curve up high (Tōdō); Tōdō notes that from Han times onwards 軒 was used mainly to mean ‘eaves’. Alternatively, this graph is taken to refer originally to a covered carriage used by those of higher status (Gu); presumably the cover projected over. OT1968:981; TA1965:583-8; GY2008:413.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 圈 . Typically taken as consisting of 囗 84 ‘enclosure’, and 卷 (traditional form of 巻 841 ‘roll; bind’) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘round enclosure’ in one interpretation (Ogawa, Shirakawa, Gu). One scholar, though, looks to take 卷 as phonetic with associated sense ‘block, obstruct’, giving ‘enclosure which blocks exit on all sides’ (Katō). OT1968:207; SS1984:260; GY2008:1251.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 兼 as right-hand element. Has 女 37 ‘woman’, and 兼 1281 (‘combine’, ‘cannot do’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘dissatisfied’, thus giving ‘woman dissatisfied’. Later, the ‘woman’ component of the meaning was dispensed with, the result being that it was generalized to ‘dissatisfied; dislike’, but the female component of the graph itself was still maintained, no doubt to avoid confusion with 1281. There are quite a number of extended or associated meanings, such as ‘disinclination’, ‘unpleasant’, ‘hatred’, ‘offensive’, ‘repugnant’ and also ‘prejudice’ and so forth – basically a wide range of negative feelings. In Chinese it can also mean ‘jealousy’ and ‘suspicion’, strongly suggesting that – certainly in earlier times – the cause of the female’s dissatisfaction involved her husband and another woman.

Number: 1289

Examples:
  • 派遣 [HAKEN] - dispatch
  • 小遣 [kozukai] - pocket money
  • 遣り直す [yarinaosu] - re-do

Etymology: Seal . Has 辶 85 ‘go, move’, and (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘continue on’ (though possibly with a semantic function also), giving ‘person continues walking after another’, i.e. ‘follow’ (Katō), or ii] ‘take just one part of something accumulated, and send/move somewhere else’ (Tōdō). ‘Send away, dispatch’ may be seen as an extended sense. The meaning ‘give’ is also probably an extended sense, deriving from the offering of items in funerary ritual (Schuessler). Ogawa notes ‘use’ as a Japanese-only usage, and this may be based on 遣 having been employed to represent the Japanese verb tsukawasu meaning ‘send, dispatch’, and then being borrowed for the separate but homophonous honorific form tsukawasu meaning ‘use’ (strictly speaking, the Old Japanese equivalents of these two verbs, but the principle involved still holds). Similarly, the meaning ‘do’ associated with 遣 may derive from the fact that the verb yaru in Old Japanese meant ‘send, dispatch’, but later there evolved yaru meaning ‘do’, as in the modern language. Note: is interpreted in one analysis as depicting hands putting a bow into a grave pit, as part of a funerary ritual (Gu), or alternatively as depicting accumulated possessions piled up (Tōdō) / clods of earth made round with the hands into a mound (Katō). KJ1970:382-3; MS1995:v2:1302-4; AS2007:425; TA1965:606; JD1967:459; OT1968:1011. As with 貴 847, we suggest taking upper right hand part as ‘odd insect’ ( 虫 60 ‘insect’), and suggest lower right as buttocks.

Regarding the later meaning ‘lock’, Shirakawa considers this to derive from an intermediate stage involving use of the graph 鍵 to denote ‘door/gate bolt’ (otherwise written 楗 ), the sense then being extended to ‘lock’ and ‘key’.

The abbreviated form 虍 – as in 虐 1201 ‘cruelty, oppress’, for instance – is a stylized representation of just the tiger’s head. GY2008:610; MR2007:315-6; MS1995:v2:1138-9; OT1968:880. Suggest take as variant of ‘building’ 广 127, 七 as ‘seven’ 32, and 儿 as legs.

<b>坑</b>

Level: L1
Number: 1320

Examples:
  • 炭坑 [TANKŌ] - coal mine
  • 坑夫 [KŌFU] - miner
  • 坑道 [KŌDŌ] - mine shaft

Etymology: Seal ( 阬 ) ; 坑 itself is a late, post- Shuowen graph. Shuowen has 阬 , consisting of 阜 ( 阝 ) 1907 ‘hill, terraced slopes’, with 亢 (‘neck / throat, high, high spirits’, see 505) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘high’, giving ‘high/big hill’. This is the opposite meaning to 坑 , and Katō looks to explain the discrepancy on the basis of use of 阬 as a substitute writing for another homophonous / near-homophonous CO graph 隍 ‘dry moat’, and by extension ‘pit, hole’; such substitutions were common in early texts. Katō’s implication is that once this substitution became common, 土 64 ‘earth, ground, soil’ replaced 阜 ( 阝 ) as the determinative, resulting in a graph whose components then appeared more logical as a way of writing the word for ‘pit, hole’. An alternative interpretation, based on an explanation of 阬 in the ancient Chinese encyclopaedic dictionary Erya , takes 阝 here in the uncommon sense ‘hollow’, thus giving ‘hollowed-out pit’ (Tōdō). According to this interpretation, 亢 is being taken as the original way of writing 坑 . KJ1970:161; TA1965:398-401; OT1968:213; AS2007:250. As with 505, we suggest taking 亢 as a desk and top, and here 土 in its meaning of ‘soil’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 亢 505 (‘neck / throat, high’) as phonetic with associated sense taken typically as ‘defend, fend off’, giving ‘defend with the hands’. Ogawa, alternatively, takes 亢 in one of its meanings as ‘high’, giving ‘raise up high’, possibly meaning ‘raise the hands high (to protect the throat)’; the original meaning of 亢 is typically taken to be ‘neck, throat’; Tōdō takes it more specifically as ‘carotid artery’. KJ1970:391; TA1965:385-91; OT1968:402. As with 505 and 1320, we suggest taking 亢 as a desk and top.

On a geo-historical note, in the Shuowen jiezi of ca.100AD, the first dictionary of Chinese characters (total: 9353) arranged according to a system of determinatives (540 in total) there are a quite remarkably frequent number relating to water and flood(/s). One may surmise that there was serious flooding around that time, even beyond China’s borders, as recorded in documentation in other countries. OT1968:572; TA1965:231,316.

Gu follows Shuowen definition of 郊 as originally denoting areas within 100 li of the capital. TA1965:270; OT1968:1019; GY2008:696.

Meanings such as ‘resist, prevent, block’ and ‘trunk/stem, branch’ may be seen as extended senses. The meaning ‘outline, summary’, as in 梗概 listed above, is treated by Gu as an extended sense (in effect, a further extended sense) based on 梗 having ‘trunk and stem’ as meanings.

OT1968:189; AS2007:279; GY2008:1424; SS1984:306-7. We suggest remembering it through ‘marquis’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 工 125 (‘work, tool’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘back, rear’, giving ‘back of the head’, and by extension ‘back/nape of the neck’. Additionally, Tōdō and Shirakawa both attribute a semantic element to 工 here, denoting a physical connection between, or support for, something above and below (head and torso); if accepted, this view perhaps provides a basis for taking other meanings such as ‘clause’ and ‘item’ as extended senses, as seen for example in the English term ‘header’ in documents.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 冓 ‘(type of) container’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘water channel, ditch’. Note: 冓 is a CO graph and was originally (OBI) a pictograph of a two-tiered bamboo container or basket(s) (Mizukami), or – in Shirakawa’s interpretation – a spinning device for bringing threads together, either way giving ‘put together, assemble’ as an extended sense. See also 701. OT1968:600; MS1995:v1:110-11; SS1984:309, 300-301. We suggest taking 井 as ‘a well’ 1575 and 再 as ‘again, twice’ 706.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 岡 1068 (‘hill’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in a semantic range signifying strength, viz. ‘big and strong’ (Ogawa), ‘thick, fat’ (Katō), ‘hard and straight’ (Tōdō); resultant overall meaning is ‘thick strong rope’, or (Tōdō) ‘hard, straight rope/cable’.

  • 草稿 [SŌKŌ] - rough draft

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 禾 87 ‘grain (plant)’, and 高 132 (‘high, tall’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘rise up high’ (Katō, Tōdō), or ii] ‘withered and hard’ (Ogawa), in either case giving ‘straw’. Regarding the meaning ‘rough draft/manuscript’, this appears to be a loan usage, though it may be that there was a semantic connection deriving from the perception of straw as something rough or coarse. The meaning ‘straw’ is now effectively defunct. KJ1970:164; OT1968:736; TA1965:261-3.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 貝 10 ‘shell (currency), valuables’, and 冓 (see 溝 1340 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘exhaustively try all means’, giving ‘buy in aggressively’, and ‘buy’ as the generalized sense (Ogawa). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes the associated sense of 冓 as ‘bring together’, and considers the original meaning of 購 as probably having been ‘reconciliation, compromise’. See also 701. OT1968:962; SS1984:315,300-01; DJ2009:v2:511. As with 1340, we suggest taking 井 as ‘a well’ 1575 and 再 as ‘twice’ 706.

Number: 1349

Examples:
  • 傲慢 [GŌMAN] - pride, arrogance
  • 傲岸 [GŌGAN] - arrogance
  • 傲然と [GŌZEN to] - haughtily

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has CO 敖 ‘enjoy oneself’ (originally, ‘emerge vigorously to a height’; see Note below) as semantic and phonetic, and 亻 41 ‘person’. Ogawa interprets 亻/人 as having been added to 敖 so as to denote mainly ‘enjoy oneself at will ’ (our italics). If, though, the interpretation of the original meaning of 敖 as ‘emerge vigorously to a height’ (Katō) is accepted, the addition of 亻/人 to create 傲 can be taken as ‘person emerges vigorously above others’, giving ‘act arrogantly’ as an extended sense. Shirakawa, alternatively, looks to interpret both 敖 and 傲 as having a ritualistic origin. Note: 敖 is taken in one view as consisting of 屮 ’shoot of vegetation’, plus 攷 (CO ‘hit and bend’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge vigorously to a height’, giving ‘sprouts of vegetation emerge’ (Katō). Shirakawa offers a quite different analysis, interpreting as representing the corpse of a long-haired old person being ritualistically beaten on a stand. OT1968:78,440,435; KJ1970:184; SS1984:318; AS2007:151. We suggest taking components as 亻 41 ‘person’, 土 64 ‘ground’, 方 223 ‘side’, and 攵 112 ‘strike’.

Examples:
  • 豪州 [GŌSHŪ] - Australia
  • 豪壮 [GŌSŌ] - splendor
  • 豪雨 [GŌU] - heavy rain

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 豕 89 ‘wild pig, boar (or similar)’, and 132 (abbreviation of 高 ‘tall, high’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘coarse animal hair’, giving ‘porcupine’ (Ogawa; Gu also in agreement), or ii] ‘long’, giving ‘boar/wild pig with long mane’ (Tōdō). ‘Bristle’ gives rise to’ brush’. ‘Outstanding/splendid’ is taken by Gu as an extended sense based on the fierce nature of the porcupine, this being perceived as a positive characteristic, though it seems this might perhaps be more understandable if the graph were taken as referring to a type of wild pig. Also used sometimes in abbreviated written style as a single-graph writing meaning ‘Australia’, and in the compound writing 豪州 GŌSHŪ ‘Australia’ (formerly written 濠州 ); in the latter case, 豪 tends to be used today in place of NJK 濠 (‘moat’). OT1968:950; GY2008:1744; TA1965:264. We suggest taking the graph as a combination of ‘house’ 家 89 and variant ‘tall’ 高 132.

Examples:
  • 手頃な [tegoro na] - convenient
  • 三時頃 [SANJIgoro] - about 3 o’clock
  • 近頃 [chikagoro] - nowadays

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Original meaning of the graph 頃 was ‘tilt/incline the head’ ( 傾 1264), consisting of 匕 , originally probably depicting a bent, withered leg, then borrowed for ’ladle, spoon’, plus 頁 103 ‘head’. Later, 頃 was borrowed to write time-related words such as ‘recently’ and ‘when’, the latter providing the basis for its meaning in Japanese. OT1968:1100; GY2008:602; TA1965:508-9. Suggest taking 匕 as ‘variant’ 七 32 ‘seven’, and a different take on ‘head’.

Shirakawa suggests that in ancient times it was probably thought that a person’s soul was like a hovering cloud. OT1968:1140; GY2008:1539; AS2007:267; SS1984:329.

  • 未開墾 [MIKAIKON] - uncultivated

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 貇 as phonetic; 貇 (see Note below) is variant of 豤 (CO, ‘boar bites’). Associated sense of 豤 / 貇 is taken as i] ‘cut down, cut’, giving ‘open up land’ (for cultivation; Ogawa), or ii] ‘clay which is hard to dig up’, giving ‘land extremely hard to dig up’ (Katō), or iii] ‘boar bites/digs down’, giving ‘dig down into the ground’ like a boar’ (Shirakawa). Shirakawa’s interpretation has some persuasiveness. ‘Cultivate/reclaim (land)’ is the extended sense. Note: 豸 , one of a small number of determinatives for wild animals (e.g. as in NJK 豹 HYŌ ‘leopard’) is based on a pictograph originally depicting a beast with arched back ready to pounce on its prey. OT1968:226,950; KJ1970:412; SS1984:329; MS1995:v2:1226-7. Suggest using top right element 艮 281 ‘stop and stare’.

OT1968:390; SS1984:330; KJ1970:412; GY2008:1158; TA1965:695-9. As with 1363, we suggest using the top right element 艮 281 as ‘stopping and staring’.

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 𧴪 (comprising 小 38 [small objects, possibly shells] over 貝 10 ‘shell, shell currency’) is taken in Shuowen as onomatopoeic to represent the sound of shells rubbing together and getting broken up. Alternatively, 𧴪 can be taken as ‘small shells strung together’, and by extension the sound of shells getting broken up (Shirakawa). Based on the interpretation of 𧴪 as ‘small shells strung together’, Ogawa analyzes 鎖 as 金 ‘metal’ with 𧴪 as phonetic with associated sense ‘put together’, giving ‘chain’ made of metal rings joined up. SS1984:334,332; OT1968:1048; GY2008:1441,418-9. Suggest taking as small 小 38.

TA1965:575-7; MS1995:v1:268-9; OT1968:414. As with 880, suggest take 坐 as ‘two people’ 人 41 sitting on the ‘ground’ 土 64.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 劑 . The seal form has 刂 198 ‘knife, cut’, and the equivalent of 斉 1578 ‘equal, similar’ (traditional form: 齊 ) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘cut and make even’. Tōdō takes this to refer to the ancient practice of cutting tallies of equal shape to mark an agreement, as well as to preparing equal individual doses of traditional medicines. Over time, the medicine-related sense became predominant. KJ1970:423; TA1965:770-73; OT1968:119.

Examples:
  • 削除 [SAKUJO] - deletion

  • 削り取る [kezuritoru] - shave off

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 削 . Has 刂 198 ‘knife, sword, cut’, and 肖 (= modern 肖 1490 ‘resemble’), taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘make small’, giving ‘shave/plane, whittle down’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or in similar vein, ‘cut off meat’ (Shirakawa, taking 肖 as ‘small piece of meat’ [treating as 小 38 ‘small, little’ over 肉 209 ‘meat, flesh’ in its variant form 月 ]). In this view, the other meaning ‘sheath, scabbard’ is seen as a borrowed usage of 削 . An alternative analysis of this graph takes as 刂 ‘knife, sword’, and 肖 as phonetic with associated sense ‘contain’, thus ‘container for knife/sword’, i.e. ‘sheath, scabbard’ (Katō); in this analysis, conversely, ‘shave/plane, pare’ is seen as the borrowed usage. OT1968:117,816; TA1965:255-7; SS1984:344; KJ1970:607. Suggest taking 肖 as small bit 小 of meat 肉 / 月 .

Later, the determinative 扌 34 ‘hand’ was added, resulting in 撮 . The kun reading tsuma mu ‘pinch’ retains some of the original meaning of this graph, while the sense ‘take (photos)’ represents a Japanese-only usage. KJ1970:501-2; OT1968:428.

Alternatively, analyzed as 斤 ‘ax; cut’ with 車 as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut off (with halberd)’, giving ‘cut off with ax’ (Katō). GY2008:603-4; KJ1970:632.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 司 524 (‘administer, take charge’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘look carefully, spy on’, giving ‘one who spies’ (Katō, Tōdō). Most meanings of this graph as used in modern Japanese appear to derive from its original sense ‘watch, investigate’. Alternatively, 司 has been taken as semantic as well as phonetic in function, giving ‘one who is in charge’ (Ogawa); this analysis finds some support in Schuessler, who notes 司 as having a meaning ‘supervisor’ in bronze texts. KJ1970:457-8; TA1965:119; OT1968:54; AS2007:477.

Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent also. MS1995:v2:600-601,24-5; KJ1970:465; OT1968:455. Suggest taking as ‘side’ 方 223 and  as ‘person’ 41.

Another view takes 次 as being an abbreviated writing for 姿 888 ‘form, appearance’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘weak/undisciplined spirit’ (Katō). TA1965:774; OT1968:369; KJ1970:467-8.

Other associated senses for 此 as phonetic in 雌 include ‘matched with (a partner)’ (listed by Mizukami). Sense generalized to ‘female (of birds, game, etc.)’. Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents also. KJ1970:265; SS1984:376; MS1995:v2:1408-9. Suggest taking 匕 as ‘sitting person’, 止 143 as ‘stop’.

Number: 1414

Examples:
  • 諮じゅん [SHIJUN] - consultation
  • 諮問 [SHIMON] - inquiry
  • 諮問機関 [SHIMONKIKAN] - advisory body

Etymology: Seal ( 咨 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has NJK 咨 (‘inquire’), the original meaning of which was ‘sigh, lament’ (Schuessler), but it was then used also to represent a separate word meaning ‘inquire, initiate discussion’. To indicate clearly in writing when the graph was being used in the latter sense, 言 118 ‘words; speak’ was added. GY2008:916; AS2007:311 SS1984:378,367. Note 1: 咨 consists of 口 ‘mouth; say’ 22, and 次 308 (‘next’) as phonetic with associated sense taken by Shirakawa as ‘open the mouth and lament’, though Shirakawa prefers to take the idiosyncratic view of treating 口 here not as ‘mouth’ but ‘prayer receptacle’, giving (in his view) ‘inquire of the deities’. Note 2: In modern Japanese usage, 諮 is used for hakaru in the sense ‘formally inquire’, as at a committee meeting. Note 3: In socio-cultural terms the Japanese use consultations and seek advice a lot more than do Westerners, not normally from lawyers (in fact, litigation is relatively rare) but from seniors, often a section head or manager at their workplace. Doing things in the prescribed way is important, and orthodoxy is greatly respected, and – perhaps on a somewhat defensive note – it also helps diffuse responsibility if things go wrong. We suggest taking 咨 as ‘next, follow’ 次 308 and 口 as ‘mouth’, or alternatively ‘opening’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, plus 寺 149 (‘temple’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘serve, wait upon’ (Tōdō says ‘remain in the one place [in attendance]’), giving ‘one who serves’. The sense ‘samurai’ (one who attends upon his lord) evolved as an additional, Japanese-only usage. KJ1970:480-81; TA1965:70-71; OT1968:60; AS2007:467. As mnemonic, we suggest two approaches: the first treating the elements person 亻 and temple 寺 ; the second taking the ‘temple’ apart and treating the graph as ‘soil, ground’ 土 64 and ‘hand’ 寸 920.

Level: L1
Number: 1418

Examples:
  • 食 [eJIKI] - food, bait, prey

  • 鳥 [torie] - bird seed

Etymology: Seal forms i] ; ii] ( 餌 ) . The first seal form given here appears in the Shuowen entry heading for this graph, with ii] noted as an alternative way of writing. In ii], 耳 31 (‘ear’) serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft’ (Ogawa). In the case of 餌 , the graph thus consists of / 食 163 ‘food; eat’, combining with 耳 as phonetic to give ‘food/rice softened (by cooking), rice-cakes’. Later, a semantic shift took place, giving rise to the more specific sense ‘animal feed’. OT1968:1116; SS1985:385; GY2008:905; DJ2009:v1:241.

Level: L1
Number: 1419

Examples:
  • 御璽 [GYOJI] - imperial seal
  • 国璽 [KOKUJI] - seal of state
  • 印璽 [INJI] - imperial seal

Etymology: Seal ( 壐 ) . Main entry heading in Shuowen has 壐 , and the equivalent of 璽 is treated in that work as an older writing. 壐 has 土 64 ‘earth’ (here, ‘clay’), and 爾 (NJK, ‘you, so’, etc.; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘push, press’, thus ‘device for making impressions’. Seal impression was into soft clay. The graph 璽 , consisting of the same phonetic 爾 as in 壐 , but complemented by 玉 15 ’jade, precious stone’, later came to be used (once more), this time to specifically denote ‘Imperial seal’ as opposed to lesser seals. The element 玉 reflects the widespread (but not exclusive) use of jade for Imperial seals; sometimes bronze was used instead. Note: 爾 is typically taken to be based on pictograph of a spinning device for winding thread onto, though Mizukami notes an alternative view which takes it as a seal with handle having cords attached. KJ1970:484-5; DJ2009:v3:1117; OT1968:662; MS1995:v2:822-4; OT1968:662.

Number: 1425

Examples:
  • 湿度 [SHITSUDO] - humidity
  • 湿地 [SHITCHI] - marshland
  • 湿っぽい [shimeppoi] - damp, dismal

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 濕 . This graph originally represented the name of a river, comprising 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’, here ‘river’, plus as phonetic. Separate from 濕 , there was another graph 溼 meaning ‘wet ground, wet’, comprising water 氵 plus 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, plus , typically taken to mean ‘cut threads’ (Tōdō takes instead as threads below horizontal line representing surface of water), as phonetic with associated sense ‘wet, soak in water’. At OBI and bronze stages, the ancestral form of 溼 lacked element 土 . Though 溼 and 濕 are treated as separate graphs in Shuowen , later they became confused, and the river name graph 濕 came to be used in the sense ‘wet’. The simplified 湿 is perhaps based on a cursive form of 濕 . Note: a historical variant once used for 濕 is 漯 , with upper element 日 mistakenly written as 田 63 ‘field’, and lower 絲 29 (threads) simplified to 糸 , though 漯 is in essence a separate graph originally denoting a river name (different from the one referred to by 濕 ). The variant need not concern us here, but it does show the complicated historical usage around 濕 / 湿 .

Examples:
  • 嫉妬 [SHITTO] - jealousy, envy
  • 嫉視 [SHISSHI] - jealous eye
  • 嫉み深い [sonemibukai] - envious

Etymology: Seal ( ) . As the entry heading, Shuowen has what today would generally be regarded as a graph of more equitable structure than 嫉 , consisting of 亻 41 ‘person’, plus 疾 1423 (‘illness’) with associated sense ‘be jealous, hate’, giving ‘person who is jealous/hates’. Also, however, Shuowen notes an alternative form with 女 37 ‘woman’, i.e. 嫉 , and over time this gained currency to the point where it eclipsed . The favored form of this graph is a reminder that modern viewpoints and values are irrelevant to the environment in early China in which graphs evolved, and possibly at times may even prove to be a hindrance to our understanding of the historical realities.

Number: 1427

Examples:
  • 漆器 [SHIKKI] - lacquerware
  • 漆黒 [SHIKKOKU] - jet black
  • 漆塗り [urushinuri] - lacquering

Etymology: Seal . Originally written 桼 depicting droplets of liquid (lacquer) dripping down from a tree 木 73, signifying ‘lacquer tree’ and by extension ‘lacquer’. According to Katō, 氵 / 水 42 ‘water, liquid’ was added as a determinative at the seal stage because it was no longer realized that the lower part of the graph 桼 already included a component indicating a liquid; note, though, that the entry 桼 in Shuowen does explain this graph as a picto-graph relating to liquid, meaning ‘tree sap’. 漆 itself is defined in Shuowen as being a river name, but this is a later loan use of the graph. Lacquerware of an extremely high standard was being produced in China as early as the Han Dynasty. DJ2009:v3:876,v2:500-01; MS1995:v2:776-7; GY2008:1755,1202; KJ1970:178; OT1968:603-4.

Examples:
  • 芝生 [shibafu*] - lawn

  • 芝刈り機 [shibakariki] - lawn mower

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation, grass’, and 之 (‘go’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘wondrous’, giving ‘wondrous plant’, referring originally to a type of mushroom considered to promote longevity. ‘Turf, grass’ is a Japanese-only sense for this graph. Note: 之 is based on a pictograph. What exactly it depicted originally (OBI stage) is disputed: interpretations include that it represented i] vegetation newly emerged above the ground, or ii] a foot trying to advance beyond a demarcating line. Either way, ‘go’ is taken to be an extended sense; in the case of ii], initially ‘advance with difficulty’, then generalized to ‘advance’, go’; apart from ‘go’, this graph is also used as a convenient way of writing several grammatical function words. SS1984:365; MS1995:v1:18-19; GY2008:228. We suggest taking 之 as a zig-zag path.

Examples:
  • 煮沸 [SHAFUTSU] - boiling

  • 煮立てる [nitateru] - bring to boil

Etymology: Seal ( ) . Seal shape is treated in Shuowen as an old form with lower element meaning ‘(type of) cauldron’, and upper element as phonetic with associated sense ‘cook slowly in liquid’, giving overall sense ‘cook slowly in liquid’. Later this complex graph was modified by retaining 者 as phonetic and adding 火 8 ‘fire’ in its variant form 灬 , giving 煮 ; we find examples of 煮 in clerical script onwards.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has right-hand component 阝 376 ‘village, place where people live’, and 牙 1090 (‘fang, tusk’) as phonetic with associated sense unknown; originally, used in writing a place name. The sense ‘evil’ for 邪 is a substitute usage in place of another graph 衺 (CO) originally meaning ‘diagonal component on front of a Chinese gown’, and by extension ‘not straight, bent’; 衺 was gradually used less, and 邪 was often employed in its place in this extended sense (Qiu). QX2000:322; OT1968:1018; GY2008:253-4; DJ2009:v2:682; MS1995:v2:1314-15.

Entry heading in Shuowen has 它 , with 蛇 noted in text as variant. GY2008:1248; OT1968:885; MS1995:v2:358-9; DJ2009:v3:1106; QX:2000:226. Take 它 as sitting person under roof.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form: 釋 . Widely taken as 釆 215 (hand holding seeds), with 睪 (‘watch criminals, espy’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘distinguish, discriminate’ (Mizukami, Katō), thus ‘put in order what has been divided up’, or ii] ‘divide’, thus ‘divide seeds’, extended to ‘release’ (Ogawa). Shirakawa, though, takes 釆 as claws of wild beast, with 睪 as showing corpse of wild beast (top part 罒 ‘net’ taken here as showing head). ‘Explain’ is extended sense. Mizukami lists proposed older equivalent for 釋/釈 . Note: 睪 has 目 76 ‘eye’, plus 幸 295 ’happiness’ taken either i] as phonetic with associated sense ‘espy; look for’, or ii] as separate graph from 幸 (though same shape), meaning ‘criminal in handcuffs’, either way giving sense ‘watch/search for criminals’.

Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents, though the phonetic element (supposedly 守 ) in these corresponds more to 単 instead. OT1968:642; KJ1970:503-04; MS1995:v2:840-41,v1:360-61.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 歹 302/520 ‘bone fragment’ (variant of 歺 , having 卜 96 ‘bone crack, divining’, over piece of bone: see Note below), and 朱 1439 (‘vermilion’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut off, cut’, giving ‘cut to death, kill’. The variant 歹 rather than 歺 is common already in clerical script as the determinative. Based on usage in an early classical text, Shirakawa feels ‘outstanding, special’ may be an extended sense of 殊 . Note: Katō, however, takes 歺 as showing top of spine. Qiu notes another possible origin of 歹 , stating ‘it first appeared [as independent graph] sometime between the Song and Yuan dynasties’, derived from shape of Tibetan letter read ta , based on close cultural contact between Song and Yuan dynasties. Note, however, that as a determinative in graphs such as 殊 the shape 歹 was already commonly used as variant of 歺 from clerical script onwards, such as in texts on wooden strips recovered from Juyan, a frontier town established ca.104BC in what is now part of Inner Mongolia.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 玉 15 ‘jade, precious stone’, and 朱 1439 (‘vermilion’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘round ball’, thus ‘pearl’.

Etymology: Seal . Has 雨 3 ‘rain’, and 而 (NJK; originally, depiction of a beard) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘become wet with rain and go soft’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘become wet’ (Katō), in either case giving overall sense ‘become wet’. In the case of this graph, the seal form onwards represents a different line of development from earlier, at least initially. The equivalent in OBI texts has a standing figure similar in shape to 大 56 ‘big’, accompanied by water droplets; this is found in bronze also, but more common is a standing figure with 雨 ‘rain’ above, showing the transitional stage towards later 需 . Meanings such as ‘seek; demand’ are loan usages. MS1995:1420-21; KJ1970:508; OT1968:1086. We suggest taking 而 as a rake.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 1447 需 (‘demand’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘weak’, giving ‘weak dwarf’. This is the view of Katō, who asserts that persons of this type were in control of various fields such as divination, music, astronomy, and divination. It is thought that shamans in ancient China were often hunch-backs or others with unusual physical characteristics. Gu agrees that there were persons in charge of fields such as those mentioned above, but makes no reference to dwarf stature or the like. The meaning ‘Confucianism’ for 儒 probably evolved as a specialised extended sense. KJ1970:508; GY2008:1892-3.

Examples:
  • 秀才 [SHŪSAI] - genius, prodigy
  • 優秀 [YŪSHŪ na] - excellent
  • 秀雄 [Hideo] - common male name

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Tends to be treated as comprising 禾 87 ‘grain plant’, and 乃 (see Note 1 below) as phonetic. In one analysis, the associated sense for 乃 here is taken as ‘extend, stretch out’, giving ‘rice (sic; see Note 2) which grows tall’, and – by extension – ‘outstanding’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘emerge’, giving ‘grain plant with ear of grain emerging’ (Katō; Gu is in agreement). Another commentator (Shirakawa) prefers to treat 秀 as originally a pictograph of a grain plant with an ear of grain hanging down, but the status of the graph he bases this judgment on is less certain. Schuessler gives the meaning of 秀 as ‘to flower and set ears’ (grain), which follows Karl-gren. Karlgren considers lower element ‘may originally have depicted the root of the plant (?).’ Note 1: 乃 (NJK, ‘whereupon; possessive particle’) is interpreted in various ways, but is typically taken as having an original meaning such as ‘bent’; this is seen in the interpretation as pictograph of ‘hunchback’ (Katō) or ‘bow’ (Ogawa), while ‘bend/curve, bend easily’ (like an ear and ear-lobe) is an extended sense noted in Mizukami. Note 2: 禾 is originally a pictograph of a grain plant, but not specifically rice (though occasionally misinterpreted as such). OT1968:729; KJ1970:513; GY2008:445; MS1995:v1:16-18; SS1984:406.

<b>襲</b>

Level: L1
Number: 1459

Examples:
  • 襲来 [SHŪRAI] - attack
  • 空襲 [KŪSHŪ] - air raid
  • 世襲 [SESHŪ] - heredity

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Seal form has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and 龍 (traditional form of 竜 2081 ‘dragon’), the latter serving here as an abbreviation of 龖 (‘flying dragons’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘pile up, pile up around’, giving ‘put covers over a corpse’, then generalized to ‘cover’; by extension this came to mean ‘conceal horses and men’, then by further extension to make a surprise attack, then generalized to simply ‘attack’. It is unclear as to how it came to acquire the meaning of ‘inherit’, though it may derive from funeral rites and associated conventions. Katō sees the main meaning as being the funeral clothing. He is quite specific in asserting that the graph indicates putting a kimono (or kimono-like clothing) on a corpse by folding the left side under the right side, presumably contrary to that of a live person wearing a kimono. In Chinese there is still a meaning for this graph of preparing for burial. He treats 龍 as a phonetic with an associated meaning of ‘wrong way’ or ‘back to front’, and treats ‘attack’, ‘pile up’, and ‘inherit’ as all being loan usages. Schuessler points to a link in early Chinese between a word for ‘habit, custom’, and one for for ‘additional robe, cover’ which could explain ‘pile up’ and ‘inherit’. OBI forms for the upper element 龍 ( 竜 ) vary considerably in shape; the greater part of the OBI form given above seems to represent a shape for ‘dragon’. Modern form of 襲 1459 retains the traditional form for 竜 2081 as top element. KJ1985:550; MS1995:v2:1172-3; QX2000:234; TA1965:798-9; OT1968:910; AS2007:524.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’ or sometimes – as here – ‘liquid’, and 十 35 (‘ten’) as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘mix in’, giving ‘liquid with ingredients mixed in’ (Shirakawa, Gu, Ogawa). Tōdō, alternatively, prefers to interpret the associated sense as ‘enter deep into’, giving ‘liquid which has sunk to the bottom of a vessel’. SS1984:414; GY2008:193; OT1968:557; TA1965:789-94.

<b>充</b>

Level: L1
Number: 1461

Examples:
  • 充分 [JŪBUN] - sufficient, enough
  • 充実 [JŪJITSU] - fullness
  • 充当 [JŪTŌ] - allot, apply

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). In one view, has 𠫓 ‘newborn infant’ (originally, pictograph of baby being born [head first and thus upside-down]; see Note 1 below), with 儿 (‘person’; a separate graph from ‘person’ 人 : see 41 and Note 2 below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘grow’, giving ‘child grows into adult’; by extension, ‘be mature/full’ (Katō). Alternatively, 儿 is taken not as phonetic but semantic in function, meaning ‘person’, combining with 𠫓 as an abbreviation of 育 247 ‘raise, educate’ to give the same overall meaning, i.e. ‘child grows to adult’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Note 1: 𠫓 is a stylized version of the seal form, which is interpreted as infant emerging from the mother’s body (the latter represented by a curved stroke like ). Kangxi zidian lists (4 strokes) as being in error for 𠫓 (3 strokes). In early 20th century Japanese book-printed font, still written as 3 strokes (e.g. in Ueda Bannen’s Daijiten [1917]), but in modern font modified to look as if begins with 亠 ; the traditional look-up determinative for 充 is 儿 (i.e. determinative 10 [cf. 人 / 亻 9]). Note 2: Interpretations vary. Mizukami interprets the seal form of 儿 as depicting the middle part of a mother’s pregnant body in side profile with swollen abdomen. Ogawa treats as ‘person’ or ‘person kneeling’. The OBI and bronze shapes (as non-independent element) for 儿 given by Gu, very close to those for 人 , became more distinctive in seal and clerical script; Gu takes as ‘person’. ‘Fill’, ‘provide’ would seem to be extended meanings.

Examples:
  • 柔道 [JŪDŌ] - judo
  • 柔弱 [NYŪJAKU] - weakness
  • 柔らか物 [yawarakamono] - silks

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses differ. One takes as 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 矛 2012 (‘halberd’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge’, thus ‘newly emerged tree plant is weak’ (Katō). Another commentator dismisses the proposal that 矛 is to be regarded here as phonetic, treating it instead as meaning ‘flexible wood for use in halberds’, and by extension ‘flexible’ (Tōdō). In similar vein, Ogawa interprets the seal form as depicting a tree (and hence wood), plus branches bending with fruit or cimilar, giving ‘flexible’ and by extension ‘soft’. KJ1970:863; TA1965:201; OT1968:500.

<b>渋</b>
Reading: JŪ, shibu
Meaning: hesitate, astringent
Strokes: 11
Level: L1
Number: 1463

Examples:
  • 渋滞 [JŪTAI] - delay
  • 渋み [shibumi] - astringency
  • 渋々 [shibushibu] - grudgingly

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 澁 . The Shuowen seal form, which lacks the ‘water’ determinative ( 氵 ), has 止 143 ‘stop, (foot, footprint’, sometimes indicates motion as well as stopping) written four times, the top two being written upside down to convey the meaning ‘not move smoothly’; subsequently, 氵 42 ‘water’ was added as determinative to clearly indicate the meaning ‘water moves slowly/stagnates’. Then in block script, the element 止 written twice upside down in this graph was slightly modified in shape, but enough to obscure – presumably inadvertently – the fact it was originally 止 . By the time of Jiyun , a Chinese rhyme dictionary published in 1037, the entry for 澀 has 澁 noted as an alternative form. The lower right-hand element (four strokes) in the modern Japanese form 渋 is a device which was used occasionally for convenience in less formal pre-modern texts to represent reduplication of an element; another example in the modern script is 摂 1596 (‘take, act as proxy’), which is a simplified version of traditional 攝 . ‘Hesitate’ is an extended sense of 渋 ; ‘astringent’ is a loan usage. DJ2009:v1:136; OT1968:586; ZY2009:v2:649; GY2008:1138; KJ1970:517-8; SS1984:416; TA1965:809. We suggest taking the bottom right element as four droplets, and 氵 as ‘liquid’.

  • 私淑 [SHISHUKU] - admiration

Etymology: Seal . Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 叔 1466 (‘uncle’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘clean, pure’, giving ‘pure water’ (Katō) or ‘clear deep water’ (Mizukami), and taking ‘good, graceful’ as a loan usage, though it may be argued that it is an extended meaning. Note: several commentators (Gu, Shirakawa) consider that originally in bronze 淑 was written in a shape corresponding to the bronze form for 弔 1714 ‘mourn’, but Mizukami and Katō maintain they were separate graphs even at that early stage. GY2008:1318; KJ1970:521; MS1995:v2:758-9,v1:466-7; SS1984:418.

<b>塾</b>
Reading: JUKU
Meaning: juku, private school
Strokes: 14

Number: 1469

Examples:
  • 塾生 [JUKUSEI] - juku student
  • 塾則 [JUKUSOKU] - juku rules
  • 私塾 [SHIJUKU] - home-based juku

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 孰 (distortion in shape of the seal form, orig. ‘cook’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘make level/even’, interpreted as ‘building with rooms having earthen walls either side of entrance gate’ (Tōdō), or – in similar vein – ‘buildings either side of entrance gate’ (Ogawa). The main building would have been for a person of high status (Gu says ‘palace’). Such rooms or buildings were used for education, and so by extension ‘private academy’, or in modern usage ‘cram school’. As an indicator of socio-cultural values regarding education, the majority of students – particularly junior high students – spend virtually as many hours in juku than they do at school. Most of them attend juku on a Saturday, and several nights a week. And there is often no consideration for political correctness: while Western schools typically try to keep students’ grades private, many juku not only ignore this, after a test they put on the blackboard not only the top few performers, but also the the worst few performers. Note: 孰 ‘cook’ was later borrowed as a convenient way of writing a homophone/near-homophone meaning ‘who?’. For further details, see 熟 905 ‘ripe, mature’. TA1965:179-84; OT1968:223,269; GY2008:1745; AS2007:471,457. We suggest taking the elements as lid/cover 亠 , 口 22 ‘hole’, 子 27 ‘child’, 土 64 ‘ground’, and 丸 101 ‘round’.

Examples:

  • 俊童 [SHUNDŌ] - prodigy

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and CO 夋 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘break out, emerge’, giving ‘outstanding person’. One commentator (Ogawa) takes ‘outstanding person’ as an extended sense based on ‘tall person’. Note: 夋 is taken in one view as consisting of 允 ‘tall slim person’, plus 夂 ‘foot’ (see Appendix), giving ‘stand tall with both feet in one spot’ (Tōdō). Alternatively, analysed as 夊 ‘foot’, ‘go slowly’, plus 允 as phonetic with associated sense ‘advance slowly’, thus ‘drag foot and hardly move’ or ‘stand still’ (Katō). See too 酸 715 and 唆 1367. As with 715 and 1367, we suggest taking the right hand part as ‘crossed legs’ 夂 and an indelicate ‘runny nose’ 允 . OT1968:63; TA1965:693; KJ1970:59-60.

  • 潤沢 [JUNTAKU] - moisture, profit

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 閏 (NJK ‘intercalary month’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘exist in excess’, giving ‘have plentiful liquid’. Note: 閏 has 王 5 (‘king, ruler’) as phonetic from seal stage onwards, and 閏 has generally been taken as meaning the emperor being in his palace for a calendrical ritual. However, based on passage in Erya (an encyclopaedic dictionary probably dating back to ca. 3 rd century BC), Shirakawa maintains that the phonetic in this graph was originally probably not 王 but 壬 785 ‘thread spool’, (also here with associated sense ‘excess; big’), a graph which at the seal stage was already very close in shape to 王 , hence the possibility of confusion between the two. DJ2009:v3:916; MS1995:v2:850-51; GY2008:1136; SS1984:426-7. Suggest taking 閏 as 門 231 ‘gate’ and ‘ 王 5 king’.

Examples:

  • 召喚 [SHŌKAN] - summons
  • 召使 [meshitsukai] - servant

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Seal onwards has 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, and 刀 198 (‘knife, cut’) as phonetic with meaning usually taken as ‘call, invite’, thus ‘call out, summon’. Another meaning (noted by Mizukami) is ‘bend back and face upwards’, thus ‘face upwards and call out’. The more complex OBI form (in bronze also), is taken to signify orig. ‘wine press made of willow branches’, with ‘call, summon’ a loan usage; this complex form was ousted at the seal stage by 召 . Other senses in Japanese such as ‘eat, drink; wear’ seem to be loan uses, taking sound value of mesu ‘call, summon’ equivalent to its meaning in Chinese when first borrowed and applying it to a homophonous verb meaning ‘eat, drink; wear’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 匸 ‘box’ (pictograph), and 斤 1233 ‘ax’, thus ‘ax in box’ &gt; ‘carpentry/carpenter’. Some scholars (Tōdō, Ogawa) take 匚 as short for 巨 1209, a square used by carpenter (probable original meaning of 巨 ‘huge’), but overall meaning is unchanged.

  • 肖り者 [ayakarimono] - lucky person

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 肖 . Has 肉 / 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, with 小 38 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘little, small, make small’, giving ‘small model (of a person)’, probably child and parents: then by extension, ‘resemble’. ‘Lucky’ is a minor meaning which appears to be a further semantic extension based on a belief of good fortune accruing through resembling another – presumably fortunate or successful – individual. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. MS1995:v2:1068-70; OT1968:816.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

Tōdō suggests focus of curving shape was either bottom or edges of a pond. Shirakawa disputes ‘curve’ as an associated sense, and takes meaning of 沼 to be ‘(natural) pond’, as does Gu. ‘Swamp/marsh’ seems to be a specific meaning in Japanese only.

Etymology: Seal . Analyses differ somewhat. Most commentators take 礻 / 示 723 as ‘altar, deity, show’, with 羊 426 (‘sheep’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘auspicious’, thus ‘good fortune, auspicious’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Mizukami, alternatively, takes the associated sense firstly as ‘deities appreciate good shape’, and by extension ‘auspicious’, but adds a cautionary note saying the shape and meaning of this graph are not certain. Gu takes the associated sense as ‘ritual offering’. Mizukami also lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents. OT1968:723; SS1984:440-41; MS1995:v2:948-9; GY2008:1155; KJ1985:447.

Number: 1497

Examples:
  • 称号 [SHŌGŌ] - title
  • 称賛 [SHŌSAN] - praise
  • 名称 [MEISHŌ] - name

Etymology: Seal ; traditional form has 爯 as right-hand element. Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ and 爯 (see Note below) ‘lift up by hand’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘lift up sheaves of grain by hand, lift up’. ‘Call out’ is regarded as an extended sense (Katō, Mizukami); Katō suggests there was a verbal component involved when sheaves of grain were lifted and probably also counted. ‘Praise’ appears to be considered a further extended sense. Mizukami lists OBI and bronze equivalents corresponding to 爯 . Note: The OBI and bronze equivalents of 爯 do suggest something in the shape of a sheaf or bale. 爯 consists of 爫 319 ‘claw’ or sometimes – as here – ‘hand’, plus the lower element taken as either (Katō), or , in either case treated as phonetic with associated sense ‘lift up’ and giving overall meaning ‘lift up by hand’. The modern form 称 is an abbreviated shape based on early (probably Tang Dynasty) calligraphic cursive models of this graph. KJ1970:549; MS1995:v2:819-20; OT1968:731; FC1974:1623-4. We suggest taking 尓 as a variant of ‘altar’ 示 723.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 召 1486 (‘summon, partake’) taken either as i] semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘join’ (Gu, Ogawa), or ii] as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend’ or ‘invite’ (Mizukami). Either way, overall original sense is ‘join threads’. By extension, generalized on the basis of bringing two things together, giving ‘introduce, inherit’. Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents. GY2008:767; OT1968:775; MS1995:v2:1010-11.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 手 34 ‘hand’, and 尙 1491 (see 尚 ‘furthermore’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘apply, put against’, thus ‘(that part of) hand placed onto something’, i.e. ‘palm of hand’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), or ii] ‘take hold of with fingers’, thus ‘take hold of something with fingers facing down’ (Katō). Based on seal form, shape of phonetic should have stayed as 尙 in the traditional form, but it seems to have changed to 尚 at quite an early period (clerical script, then block script). ‘Control’ is an extended sense (cf English ‘manipulation’).

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Originally a pictograph. Some OBI occurrences have three identical elements similar in shape to 口 22 ‘mouth’, while others have three elements similar in shape to 日 66 ‘sun’, but in all cases each element is unrelated to ‘sun’ or ‘mouth’, instead representing what appears as a small star in the sky, so the original meaning of the graph is ‘star(s)’; by extension, ‘clear light’, ‘crystal’. QX2000:223; MR2007:357; GY2008:1418; KJ1970:596. For convenience we suggest remembering the graph as ‘three suns’.

Examples:
  • 硝酸 [SHŌSAN] - nitric acid
  • 硝薬 [SHŌYAKU] - gunpowder
  • 硝子 [garasu*] - glass

Etymology: A late, post- Shuowen graph. Originally used to mean a mineral encrustation often called ‘saltpeter’, i.e. potassium nitrate, employed in traditional Chinese medicine for digestion and as a laxative. Reflecting this, the corresponding word in Chinese was at first written using the different graph (but same phonetic) 消 332 (‘extinguish’). Later, the new graph 硝 was devised, replacing 氵 42 ‘water’ with 石 47 ‘rock’. The graph comprises 石 ‘rock, stone’, and 肖 1490 (‘resemble’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘absorb, digest’, giving ‘rock mineral to aid digestion’, and by extension – based on the later use of saltpeter (Song Dynasty onwards) – ‘gunpowder’ (Katō). Ogawa, alternatively, takes the associated sense of 肖 here as ‘pointed, sharp’, giving ‘type of mineral with crystals’, reflecting the naturally-occurrent state of saltpeter. On a historical note, China is credited with the first use of gunpowder. Moreover, by the 10th century it had the most sophisticated weaponry in the world, including explosive rockets, land mines, and flame-throwers. Despite this, they were beaten by the Mongols in the 13th century. When the Mongols went on to attempt to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281 – thwarted on both occasions by typhoons (kamikaze, ‘divine wind’) – they took gunpowder-based weaponry, such as cannon and grenades. It is a profound mystery in Japanese history as to why the Japanese did not try to develop their own gunpowder-based weaponry, for they could easily have retrieved cannons from sunken Mongol ships (or, earlier, simply by visiting China). Instead, they waited until the arrival of Portuguese in 1543, with cumbersome arquebuses, which were promptly improved by the Japanese. KJ1970:608-9; OT1968:712; SS1984:445; GY2008:1397-8.

Etymology: Seal . Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 召 1486 (‘summon’) taken in one view as semantic and phonetic (or just phonetic), meaning ‘call out facing upwards’, and taken to signify i] ‘call out and summon others, announce to inferiors’ (Mizukami), or ii] ‘inform the deities’ (Shirakawa). Ogawa, who takes 召 here as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘call out, call’, giving ‘call over and inform’, notes that from the Qin Dynasty onwards this graph was used to refer to edicts issued by the emperor. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. MS1995:v2:1192-3; SS1984:446; OT1968:925.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 獎 . The seal form has 犬 19 ‘dog’, and abbreviation of 將 (traditional form of 将 911 ‘command[er]’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘set a dog on someone and urge on’, giving generalized meaning ‘urge on, encourage’. The Zhengzitong and Kangxi zidian (Peking Palace printed edition), though, favor not 犬 ‘dog’ but 大 56 ‘big’, and this latter form ( 奬 ) was also favored in the first Jōyō kanji List, promulgated in 1923; later abbreviated to 奨 .

Etymology: Seal ; Has 彡 (see 115), a determinative whose meanings include ‘light/bright, adorn’, and 章 334 (‘chapter’; orig ‘tattooing needle’, by extension ‘tattoos’) taken either as i] phonetic with associated sense ‘make clear’, thus ‘clear embellishment’ (Katō), or ii] semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘markings, pattern’ (Ogawa), to give overall sense ‘bright and clear’ (Tōdō). Shirakawa takes both elements as semantic, but also – like Katō – leading to the overall sense ‘clear embellishment’. KJ1970:535; OT1968:346; TA1965:347; SS1984:448.

Etymology: Seal form (with 童 385 as center element): ( Shuowen ). Has 彳 / 行 131 ‘go, move’ (originally pictograph of crossroads), and what in seal form was 童 (‘child’ 385) taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘gather’, thus ‘central point where roads come together’ and by extension ‘major road’; ‘collide’ is treated as loan usage in this view (Ogawa). Later, center element was changed to 重 326 (‘heavy’) as phonetic (same associated sense), 重 and 童 being near-homophones in Late Han times (Schuessler). Another view takes earlier 童 as phonetic and probably abbreviation for NJK 撞 ‘strike against’ (Shirakawa). DJ2009:v1:160; OT1968:899; SS1984:451; AS2007:500,622.

Several other scholars take original meaning as ‘atone for’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa). KJ1970:540; OT1968:83; SS1984:453.

Number: 1515

Examples:
  • 丈夫 [JŌBU] - robust, sturdy
  • 背丈 [setake] - one’s height
  • 方丈 [HŌJŌ] - ten feet square

Etymology: Seal . In one view, analyzed as consisting of 又 2003 ‘hand’ (but here to be taken rather as ‘handspan’), and 十 35 ‘ten’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘ten handspans’ (Katō; see 尺 895). Supposedly a linear measurement unit of about ten feet, but some latitude needs to be given in interpretation here: standards for measurement varied significantly in the Zhou Dynasty, a situation which led the self-styled ‘First Emperor’ (Shih Huangdi) of the Qin Dynasty to standardise weights and measures. Ogawa, alternatively, takes original meaning as ‘hand holding a stick’ (later written 杖 , NJK, ‘stick’), as does Gu. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent.

Number: 1516

Examples:
  • 冗談 [JŌDAN] - joke
  • 冗長 [JŌCHŌ] - verbosity
  • 冗語 [JŌGO] - redundant word

Etymology: Seal . At seal stage, written with 宀 30 ‘roof; building’, plus a lower element interpreted as either i] 儿 ‘person’ (a separate graph from 人 41; see 1461 Note 2), giving 宂 , or ii] 人 41 ‘person’. Katō takes the former view, considers the meaning in this graph to be ‘weak hunch-back’ (based on word-family connection), giving ‘weak hunchback unoccupied at home without work’. The Shuowen seal form of this graph does have the lower element written with what could be interpreted as representing a hump on the back. However, others consider it better to take the lower element as just 人 ‘person’. Accordingly, Gu takes it as ‘person at leisure at home’, and Ogawa is in agreement, saying ‘person at home without agricultural work’; all the above scholars following the definition of the graph in Shuowen to some degree. The original form with 宀 appears to have been replaced by semantically close 冖 ’cover’ after Han times; fluctuation in the lower element continued until 几 (in this graph a shape distortion, probably inadvertent) predominated, giving the shape 冗 familiar in modern Japanese usage. Regarding other meanings such as ‘waste, excess’, Katō regards these as extended senses based on a person being without work and hence unfocused, but Ogawa regards as loan usage. DJ2009:v2:590; KJ1970:552-3; GY2008:116; OT1968:101; MS1995:v1:88-9,40-41. Suggest taking 几 as a desk, and 冖 as a cover.

Examples:
  • 浄化 [JŌKA] - purification
  • 不浄 [FUJŌ] - filth
  • 浄水 [JŌSUI] - clear water

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 淨 . Consists of 氵 42 ‘water’, and 爭 (traditional form of 争 558 ‘conflict’) as phonetic, with associated sense disputed. Gu and Ogawa regard 淨 as an abbreviation of 瀞 ; both listed in Shuowen ; Gu lists a bronze form for 瀞 . 瀞 consists of 氵 ‘water’, plus 靜 (traditional form of 静 548 ‘quiet, calm’, see also 558), taken here by Gu as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘clear, without impurities’ (regarding still water as clear, unmuddied). The meaning of 淨 is given in Shuowen as the name of a pool near the capital of Lu (a state in ancient China). Given this, Katō treats the associated sense of 爭 in 淨 as unclear (Ogawa also takes this approach), and regards the meaning ‘clear, pure’ for 淨 as a borrowed usage in place of 瀞 . Despite some differences, all the above scholars are in agreement in tracing the origins of 淨 / 浄 back to 瀞 . GY2008:700-701; OT1968:574; KJ1970:431.

Used in Japanese for the verb tatamu ‘fold over, pile up’, and then for tatami ‘mat’. Originally, such mats were probably quite thin and readily folded. Later, though, they became much more substantial in construction, having a stiff core by tradition made of rice straw covered with a woven cover of rush straw. Being of a set size (approximately six feet by three, though there can be minor variation), with the length always twice the width, tatami mats are also used as a measure of room size. The abbreviated modern form 畳 , which has lost the short vertical stroke from its lower element 宜 and two ‘fields’, was officially adopted into the T ōyō kanji List promulgated in 1946. OT1968:673; GY2008:1673; KJ1970:718-9. We suggest taking 冝 as ‘not quite proper’. Take 田 as ‘field’ 63.

<b>縄</b>

Examples:
  • 沖縄 [Okinawa] - Okinawa
  • 縄張り [nawabari] - cordon, ‘patch’
  • 自縄自縛 [JIJŌJIBAKU] - fall in own trap

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 繩 . Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and CO 黽 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘become twisted’ (Ogawa), giving ‘twisted fibers’. Note: as an independent graph, 黽 means ‘frog, toad’. As the phonetic in 繩 , Shuowen regards it as an abbreviation of 蠅 NJK ‘fly’, though this is academic, since it does serve only as phonetic here and has no semantic role. OT1968:792; DJ2009:v3:1071,1107; GY2008:1353. We suggest taking the right-hand part of 1520 as two ‘days’ 日 66 and the down stroke as cord/rope.

Examples:
  • 土壌 [DOJŌ] - earth, soil
  • 壌土 [JŌDO] - loamy soil
  • 天壌 [TENJŌ] - heaven and earth

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 壤 . Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 襄 (‘remove garment’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft and fertile, soft’, giving ‘soft and and fertile soil’. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. Note: the seal form corresponding to block script 襄 is made up of 衣 444 ‘garment’, plus a phonetic with associated sense ‘remove’. Resultant overall sense ‘remove garment’ is explained in Shuowen , with reference to a Han time edict directing the populace to remove outer garments and work in the fields. Abbreviation in shape of right-hand element is standard in modern Japanese (see e.g. 1522). MS1995:v1:280-81; KJ1970:554; O1968:226; GY2008:1952. We suggest taking the right-hand part as ‘six’ 六 80, ‘well’ 井 1575, and as a variant of ‘clothing’ 衣 444.

Number: 1522

Examples:
  • 令嬢 [REIJŌ] - young lady
  • 愛嬢 [AIJŌ] - beloved daughter
  • お嬢さん [oJŌSAN] - young lady

Etymology: Seal , a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 孃 . Has 女 37 ‘woman’, and 襄 (‘remove garment’; see 1521 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘superior’, giving original meaning ‘mother’, and then – through confusion with the homophonous graph 娘 2014 ‘young lady, daughter’ – used also for ‘daughter, girl’ (Ogawa). Katō also takes ‘high, lofty’ as one possible associated sense, but notes ‘take charge’ as another, again leading to the meaning ‘mother’ (probably on the basis of one who is in charge of a household) and then too for ‘girl, young lady’. The Shuowen itself explains 孃 as meaning ‘confusion’, or alternatively ‘fat, corpulent’, and on the basis of the latter sense Shirakawa takes 孃 to refer to corpulent females, both mothers and daughters. Katō, however, considers this interpretation to be flawed. In the Tang Dynasty, both 嬢 and 娘 appear to have had a polite connotation (‘lady’ [Schuessler]). OT1968:263; KJ1970:554-5; DJ2009:v3:1027-8; SS1984:460; AS2007:401. As with 1521, we again suggest taking the right-hand part as ‘six’ 六 80, ‘well’ 井 1575, and as a variant of ‘clothing’ 衣 444.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 定 371 (‘fix’, ‘decide’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘stable, steady’ (Gu), giving ‘metal artefact which is stable’, referring originally to an ancient bronze ritual food vessel with legs (Ch.: ding ). By extension or loan, it came to denote metal ingots or other ingot-shaped items such as ink cakes and tablets. ‘Lock’ appears to be a Japanese-only sense.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 讓 . Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 襄 (‘remove garment’; see 1521 Note)) as phonetic with associated original sense taken either as i] ‘charge, blame’, giving ‘charge, lay an accusation’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘push into’, giving ‘push someone into questioning’ (noted by Mizukami). Katō, who arrives at a similar overall meaning, i.e. ‘two persons blame each other’, regards the later predominant sense ‘concede, yield’ as a loan use. OT1968:945; MS1995:v2:1215-17; KJ1970:553-4; AS2007:439. As with 1521, and linking in with the 1522 mnemonic, we suggest taking the right-hand part as 六 80 ‘six’, 井 1575 ‘well’, and as a variant of 衣 444 ‘clothing’.

  • 殖え高 [fuedaka] - increment

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 歹 ‘bone fragment; die’ (see 1441), and 直 192 (‘direct, upright’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘adhere, be sticky’, thus ‘flesh on corpse rots and goes mushy’ (Katō), or ii] ‘rot, decay’, (Ogawa). ‘Increase’ is seen as a loan sense by Katō. Ogawa considers ‘increase’ derives from the graph 殖 having been used interchangeably with 植 337 ‘plant’ at one stage (both were homophones in Late Han), ‘increase’ being an extended sense from ‘plant’. Tōdō, like Shirakawa, links these two graphs and the underlying words. KJ1970:557; OT1968:544; TA1965:89.

Etymology: Seal . Has 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, and (CO; see Note below) taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘wipe’, giving ‘wipe clean with cloth’, and by extension ‘make nice, decorate’ (Ogawa, Mizukami). Mizukami lists a proposed bronze form. Alternatively, is taken as ‘person in front of food vessel’ (  here is a variant of 人 41 ‘person’), with 巾 ‘cloth’, thus ‘wipe food utensils clean’ (Shirakawa). In the latter interpretation, ‘make nice, decorate’ may be seen as an extended sense. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. Note: The meaning of is given as ‘provisions’ in Shuowen , and ‘feed’ in Yupian . OT1968:319; MS1995:v2:1456-7; SS1984:465; ZY2009:v4:1529.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 觸 . Has 角 97 ‘horn’, and 蜀 (see 766, ‘caterpillar; Chu [name of ancient Chinese state]’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘strike’, thus ‘push/stab with horn’ (still a meaning in Chinese); by successive extensions of meaning, ‘infringe, violate’, ‘touch’. Abbreviation of right-hand element 蜀 to 虫 60 ‘insect’ appears to be a late modification (block script). OT1968:918; TA1965:285; GY2008:1633.

Examples:

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 寸 920 ‘hand’ beneath 辰 ‘Dragon’ (fifth of the Twelve Branches used in traditional Chinese culture for purposes such as timekeeping). Note that ‘dragon’ is an early (OBI) loan use of 辰 , which derives from a pictograph of a large clam (bivalve mollusc); Katō considers the OBI and bronze forms show clams with muscle tissue outside the shell to enable movement. 辱 represents a hand holding a clam shell sharpened for cutting vegetation. This etymology is clearly seen in the OBI form for 農 386 ‘farming’, a graph which incorporates 辱 . ‘Shame, humiliation’ is usually seen as a loan usage, but it may reflect an extended meaning similar to the English ‘cutting remark’. KJ1970:561-2,948; MS1995:v2:1280-81; OT1968:288; SS1984:466.

Over time, the meaning of ‘anus’ itself has been virtually displaced by these extended meanings, and the common term for ‘anus’ nowadays is shiri no ana (‘buttock hole’) or the medical term 肛 門 ( kōmon ).

Etymology: A very late, post- Shuowen graph. Consists of 艹 53 ‘vegetation, plant’, with 心 164 ‘heart’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘core/pith of plant or vegetation’. Originally referred in particular to a type of rush, the oily pith of which can be used as a lamp wick, leading to extended senses such as ‘wick’ and also to denote the central part of items such as in ‘padding (of quilt)’, ‘(pencil) lead’. GY2008:384; OT1968:845.

Level: L2
Number: 1535

Examples:
  • 辛苦 [SHINKU] - hardship
  • 辛味 [karaMI] - sharp taste
  • 辛うじて [karōjite] - barely

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Originally, pictograph of a large needle with sideways projections partway down, presumably to make it easier to push the needle into the target surface. The significance of the top horizontal stroke in OBI and seal (changed to near-vertical or vertical in block script) is not clear. This graph is widely considered to represent a needle for tattooing the foreheads of slaves and criminals as a mark of ownership. Tattooing was also one of the ancient Five Punishments, the others being cutting off the nose, cutting off a foot, castration, and capital punishment (ancient Chinese culture exhibits a fondness for numerical categories). The original meaning ‘tattooing needle’ (for slaves and criminals) gave rise to various extended senses such as ‘crime’, ‘painful’, ‘bitter, pungent’. The additional meaning ‘eighth of the ten Heavenly Stems’ (used in the traditional Chinese year-counting system) is a loan use. MS1995:v2:1274-5; KJ1970:942-3; OT1968:989; AS2007:538. We suggest taking the graph as 立 77 ‘stand’ and 十 35 ‘ten’.

Examples:
  • 津々 [SHINSHIN] - brimful
  • 津波 [tsunami] - tidal wave
  • 津々浦々 [tsutsuuraura] - throughout land

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses vary. In one view, has 氵 / 水 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 聿 400 (‘writing brush’), itself as abbreviation of 𦘔 (‘writing brush hairs’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘river crossing place’, giving overall meaning ‘river crossing place’ (Katō). Gu, who takes 𦘔 to be the original way of writing 津 , considers on the basis of the OBI equivalent that 𦘔 originally depicted a person crossing a river or stream using a pole, and hence ‘river crossing place’. Ogawa, alternatively, analyzes as 水 ‘water, river’, plus 聿 as phonetic with associated sense ‘advance’, giving ‘cross river and advance, river crossing’, and the means to do so, i.e. ‘ferry’. The meaning ‘harbor’ is a Japanese-only usage. KJ1970:55-6; GY2008:956; OT1968:574. We suggest taking 聿 as ‘brush in hand’.

Examples:
  • 唇音 [SHIN’ON] - labial sound
  • 口唇 [KŌSHIN] - lips
  • 陰唇 [INSHIN] - labia

Etymology: Seal form A ( 脣 ) ; seal form B ( 唇 ) ; late graphs (both are listed, as separate entries, in Shuowen ). At the seal stage, the graph meaning ‘lips’ was written 脣 ( 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’), and 辰 (originally, pictograph of large clam; see 1531) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake, tremble, move quickly’, giving ‘(part of) body which moves quickly’, i.e. ‘lips’. Separate from 脣 , there was another graph 唇 , having 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’ as determinative as opposed to 肉 . Originally, 唇 meant ‘be startled’, but this graph was borrowed from the Later Han period with a second meaning, viz. ‘lips’, and the two graphs were used interchangeably until the Song and Yuan dynasties (Gu). The later Kangxi zidian prescribed only 脣 as correct usage for the meaning ‘lips’, treating 唇 as erroneous in this sense. The form 唇 was officially approved in Japan when included in the Jōyō List promulgated in 1981. GY2008:1016; OT1968:823; DJ2009:v1:117; ZY2009:v2:345; SK1996:1356.

Number: 1540

Examples:
  • 振動 [SHINDŌ] - swing
  • 振り切る [furikiru] - shake off
  • 二年振り [ninenburi] - after two years

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 辰 (orig. ‘large clam’, see 1531) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake, move about’, thus ‘shake about’ (Ogawa). Katō, however, takes orig meaning ‘open up (a clam)’, and ‘move about, shake’ as extended sense from clam moving about. Furi ‘postures (in dance); manner’ derives from kun reading furu ‘shake’, as also the verbal suffix - buru ‘pose, put on airs’. Use of 振 for another suffix, -buri ‘after (time interval)’, is also loan use based on sound value furu . OT1968:414; KJ1970:560-61.

Number: 1542

Examples:
  • 紳士 [SHINSHI] - gentleman
  • 紳士録 [SHINSHIROKU] - Who’s Who
  • 紳士的 [SHINSHITEKI] - gentlemanly

Etymology: Seal . This graph has 糸 29 ‘thread, cord’, together with 申 338 (‘say, expound’) as a phonetic with an associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘extend, stretch’, this being interpreted to give the following overall meanings: i] ‘long sash to extend around the waist’ (Mizukami, Tōdō), or ii] ‘sash to wear to straighten body posture’ (Mizukami). Shirakawa, by contrast, takes the associated sense as ‘bundle/put together’, thus giving ‘sash to bring garments together’. It appears that 紳 was used to denote more elaborate sashes of a type worn by males of noble status, thus giving rise to the extended sense ‘gentleman’. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. In Chinese, in addition to ‘gentleman’, this graph retains meanings of ‘bind’ and ‘waistband’, whereas ‘sash, belt’ is effectively redundant in Japanese. SS1984:474; MS1995:v2:1010-12; TA1965:756. We suggest taking the elements of the modern form 申 as comprising 日 66 ‘sun’ and a long vertical stroke representing piercing.

  • 往診 [ŌSHIN] - house-call

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words, speak,’, together with (CO, ‘thick/luxuriant hair’, etc; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘without gap/omission’, giving ‘make a judgement without omission’ (Tōdō), or ii] ‘press down’, giving ‘press pulse of sick person and check, examine’ (Ogawa). From an early stage the concept of examination and judgement was narrowed to health. Note: is comprised of the determinative character 彡 (‘feathers’, ‘hairs’, see 115), in Tōdō’s view, a pictographic representation of long hair, beneath an element which in the seal form is 人 41 ‘person’, modified in block script to 人 . Mizukami also agrees regarding the seal stage, but suggests OBI and bronze forms might instead depict a person urinating. This is not particularly significant since the dictionary or central meaning of is unrelated to its associated sense. Mnemonically, 人 can be taken properly as person, or alternatively it could be taken as a cover. MS1995:v1:44-6;TA1965:743-6; GY2008:514.

Number: 1546

Examples:
  • 審議 [SHINGI] - deliberation
  • 不審 [FUSHIN] - doubt
  • 審判 [SHINPAN] - judgment, umpiring

Etymology: Seal ( 宷 ) . Entry heading in Shuowen has 宷 , comprising 宀 30 ‘roof, building’ over 釆 215 (orig open hand holding grain or similar &gt; ‘divide up, distinguish’), thus ‘clarify matters deep inside a house’ (Katō). Katō considers 宀 here carries the nuance ‘deep inside’ through a word-family connection with 深 342 ‘deep’, and this is supported by Schuessler, who also notes a possible link. Ogawa takes the meaning as ‘separate and clarify matters covered over’. Gu interprets the graph (both 宷 and 審 ) as meaning ‘inquire into/examine closely inside a room’. The same Shuowen entry also notes the form with 番 215 (‘number; guard’) substituted for 釆 , i.e. 審 . Adoption of 番 as the lower element as an alternative to 宷 at the seal stage may reflect influence of an earlier variant form. DJ2009:v1:95; MS1995:v2:1352-4; KJ1970:566; AS2007:458; OT1968:284; GY2008:727-8.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

  • 奮迅 [FUNJIN] - great rage

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 辶 ‘walk, go, move’ 85, and 卂 (‘bird flying’ [Gu], or ‘falcon’ [Shirakawa]). Gu takes 卂 as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘rapid’ as an extended sense from ‘bird flying’ (Ogawa is in agreement). Shirakawa follows a different interpretation and takes this element as phonetic with associated sense ‘rapid’, giving ‘move rapidly’ as the original sense. GY2008:340; SS1984:480; OT1968:993. We suggest taking as ‘canopy’ and 十 35 as ‘ten’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 肉 / 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, and 臤 1237 (CO,‘pluck out eye [as punishment]’) as phonetic. Associated sense of 臤 here is regarded as unclear, but possibly ‘remove’, giving ‘bodily part which removes (waste fluid)’. Shuowen explains as being where (bodily) fluid is stored. OT1968:824; GY2008:611. We suggest using 臣 543 ‘minister, eye’, and 又 2003 ‘hand’.

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Originally, pictograph of a man’s head/face 頁 103 with wavy lines 彡 here meaning whiskers of a beard, (see also 115 and 517). Borrowed for its sound value as a convenient way to write another homophonous or near-homophonous word in early Chinese meaning ‘must, should’. Mizukami lists several proposed OBI equivalents. MS1995:v2:1442-3; GY2008:891; OT1968:1101; WD1974:629-31.

  • 自炊 [JISUI] - self-catering

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 火 8 ‘fire’, and 欠 496 (‘lack’) as abbrev of 吹 1557 ‘blow’ as semantic and phonetic &gt; ‘blow upon fire’ to make bigger. As fire is important for cooking, ‘cook’ evolved as extended meaning. GY2008:704-5; KJ1970:577; OT1968:617.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 粹 . Has 米 220 ‘rice’, and 卒 564 (‘end; soldier’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pound, smash’, thus ‘rice well pounded and impurity-free’; i.e. ‘pure’. The meaning ‘smart, stylish’ is Japanese-only usage. The simplified form 粋 seems to have become popular in the Northern Wei Dynasty (387-534). OT1968:761; SS1984:484-5; FC1974:v2:1689.

Etymology: Seal . The seal form has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and a second element between the upper and lower parts of 衣 to represent (interwoven) straw or similar pointed downwards, giving ‘rain-cape, cape’. Shuowen defines as ‘rain-cape made from vegetation’. Gu alone prefers to interpret as incorporating a hat also. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. MS1995:v2:1166-7; OT1968:902; GY2008:1104.

By extension, ‘become intoxicated’; also, ‘feel sick’, ‘feel elated’. The form 酔 seems to be based on cursivized forms circa Tang Dynasty onwards. FC1974:v2:2285-6; OT1968:1026; TA1965:694-5; GY2008:1791. Take right-hand as 九 13 ‘nine’ and 十 35 ‘ten’.

  • 午睡 [GOSUI] - nap, siesta

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 目 76 ‘eye’ and 垂 918 ‘suspend, hang, droop’. The latter element is taken either as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘lower eyelids’, and by extension ‘sleep’ (Ogawa, Gu), or as just phonetic with associated sense ‘limp, flabby’, giving ‘eyes get tired and go limp’, with ‘sleep’ likewise as the meaning by extension (Katō, Tōdō). OT1968:701; GY2008:1584; KJ1970:577.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form: 隨 . Has 辶 85 ‘walk, go’, and 隋 (CO ‘shredded sacrificial meat’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘follow, accompany’, thus ‘follow behind’ (Katō, Ogawa). Tōdō takes the associated sense as ‘hang down limp’, but still arrives at the same overall meaning (‘hang on, follow from behind’). KJ1970:417-8; TA1965:544; OT1968:1007,824; BK1957:23.

Level: L1
Number: 1567

Examples:
  • 真髄 [SHINZUI] - essence
  • 脳髄 [NŌZUI] - brain
  • 骨髄 [KOTSUZUI] - bone marrow

Etymology: Seal ( 𩪦 ) ; traditional ( 髄 ) 髓 . What is seen as seal script predecessor of 髄 has 骨 877 ‘bone’, and 隓 (CO ‘destroy, dismantle’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘fat’, thus ‘fat inside bone’ (Katō). Later form 髓 , the traditional form, was once seen as popular equivalent of 𩪦 in which the phonetic element 隓 is replaced by 遀 (CO of unclear status and meaning); Ogawa takes associated sense of 遀 here differently from the associated sense of 隓 above, seeing it as ‘linked to inside’, thus overall sense ‘centre of bone’. Examples of simpler form 髄 date from Northern Wei Dynasty (387-534). FC1974:v2:2515; ZY2009:v4:1349; GY2008:2017; OT1968:1133; KJ1970:417; BK1957:23.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 樞 . Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 區 282 (‘section, ward’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hinge pin, pivot’, giving ‘(wooden) pivot’, and by extension ‘main/vital point’. 枢 appears to be a late simplified form. KJ1970:504; TA1965:310; AS2007:471.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 山 26 ‘mountain’, and 宗 899 (‘religion’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘come together, gather’ or ‘pile up’, giving ‘mountains come together and pile up’ (Katō). Alternatively, 宗 here is taken by Ogawa as meaning ‘admired’, giving ‘most admired high mountain’. Either way, by extension ‘look up high to, revere’. KJ1970:644; OT1968:305; AS2007:363.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 扌 / 手 64 ‘hand’, with 居 678 (‘reside, be’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘bent’, giving ‘hand shrinks/becomes stiff’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘injury’, to give – in similar vein – ‘hand injury’ (Shirakawa) (Gu says ‘hand disease’). By contrast, Katō sees the main meaning (in Japanese only) as ‘hands being busy in a work context’, leading to a variety of extended meanings, such as ‘place down’, ‘set’, and ‘work’. In all cases, hands and their activities are core. OT1968:417; SS1984:181; GY2008:1224; KJ1985:263.

<b>裾</b>

Number: 1572

Examples:
  • 山裾 [yamasuso] - foot of mountain
  • 裾模様 [susoMOYŌ] - design on skirt
  • 裾裏 [susoura] - hem lining

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 衣 / 衤 444 ‘garment’, and 居 678 (‘be, reside’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘cover what is beneath’, giving ‘(part of) garment which covers from outside’ (Tōdō); as a hem or cuff presumably involves folding the edge of fabric on the outside and fixing it onto the underside. This analysis therefore appears to already provide the meaning ‘hem, cuff’, though Tōdō takes this as a later, restricted meaning. In support of taking ‘hem, cuff’ as a later sense, on the other hand, is the Shuowen entry for 裾 , which defines it as ‘front part of a garment’. In line with this, the treatment by Gu also favors taking ‘front part of a garment’ as the original meaning, and several other meanings such as ‘back of a garment’ as extended senses. In Chinese only it can have a meaning of ‘robe’, which presumably could also be worn by males, whereas in Japan it is very much associated with females. Nor does the Chinese appear to encompass the extended concept of the ‘hem’ of a mountain. DJ2009:v2:677; TA1965:385; GY2008:1668. As one mnemonic we suggest taking 居 as 古 121 ‘old’ and 尸 256 ‘corpse’.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 賴 . This graph consists of 氵 / 水 42 water’, and 賴 (traditional form of 頼 2067 ‘request, rely’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘push forward/affect violently’, giving ‘violent rapid current’ (Katō, Tōdō), or ii] ‘rub’, giving ‘strong current which rushes over rocks’ (Ogawa). In early China it was also applied to the name of a specific river in Kuangxi. KJ1970:890-91; TA1965:551; OT1968:613. For the middle and right-hand elements we suggest taking as 束 561 ‘parcel’ and 頁 103 ‘head’.

Examples:
  • 征服 [SEIFUKU] - subjugation
  • 遠征 [ENSEI] - expedition
  • 征夷 [SEII] - pacifying barbarians

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Originally written as just 正 43 (‘correct, proper’), the OBI form of which has a foot pointed upwards towards an element shaped like 口 22 (‘mouth; entrance; hole’,) which Qiu takes as representing a destination. Since there were two words in early Chinese (Late Han) meaning ‘correct’ and ‘march against’ respectively and these were homophones, to clearly distinguish the latter in writing the element 彳 131’go/walk along a road’ (abbreviated form of 行 [originally, ‘crossroads’]) was added, resulting in 征 . Note: 彳 together with an upward-facing foot combine to give 辵 ‘walk step-by-step along a road’ (full way of writing 辶 / 辶 85). As both 彳 and 辶 / 辶 have much the same meaning, early graphs sometimes fluctuate between the two. For this reason, in pre-modern texts variants such as, for instance, 征 written with 辶 / 辶 as determinative instead of 彳 are sometimes encountered. QX2000:191-2,330; MS1995:v2:1286-7,v1:702-3; AS2007:612.

Main entry heading in Shuowen has 士 521 ‘male’ as determinative, but it notes graph written with 女 37 ‘woman’ as alternative form, suggesting 壻 was probably original form. 胥 (CO ‘assist’) is phonetic with associated sense ‘intelligent’, thus – for 壻 – ‘intelligent/fine male’, or – for 婿 – ‘’intelligent/fine male for a woman’; later ‘son-in-law’. DJ2009:v1:32; KJ1970:964; OT1968:260. Use 疋 ‘leg’ 1574, and 月 ‘body’ 209.

Examples:
  • 排斥 [HAISEKI] - boycott
  • 斥候 [SEKKŌ] - patrol, scout, spy
  • 斥力 [SEKIRYOKU] - repulsion

Etymology: Seal . The original way of writing this graph is generally taken as , which consists of 广 127 ‘building, house’, and 屰 675 (‘adverse’; originally, showing person upside-down) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘strike, repel’, giving ‘remove/clear away a house/building’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, taken as 斤 1233 ‘ax’ with 丶 added as a marker to indicate ‘cut, notch’, giving original meaning ‘cut and split with ax’ (Tōdō). As Gu points out, though, 斥 does appear to have evolved through changes in shape from through an intermediate stage such as 厈 , a shape from which it was a relatively small step to 斥 . Examples of 厈 can be found at the clerical script stage. OT1968:450; TA1965:353-4; GY2008:177; SK1984:357-8. Suggest taking the short downstroke as indicating ‘down’.

Examples:

  • 惜別 [SEKIBETSU] - parting regrets

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, and 昔 346 (‘olden times, past’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘painful, stab’, giving ‘painful heart’ (Katō, Gu), or ii] ‘make smaller’, giving ‘make the heart smaller, feel regret’ (Ogawa). It is possible that 昔 may also play a semantic role, namely ‘past’, for regret is usually felt in relation to an event that has already occurred, or if one is reluctant to commit an act that has yet to occur but one that might later cause regret. GY2008:1327; KJ1970:616; OT1968:376.

<b>跡</b>

Strokes: 13
Level: L1
Number: 1592

Examples:
  • 追跡 [TSUISEKI] - pursuit
  • 足跡 [ashiato] - footprint
  • 遺跡 [ISEKI] - ruins

Etymology: Seal ( 迹 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The entry heading for 迹 (NJK; ‘place where people walk’ &gt; ‘marks left by people walking’, i.e. ‘footprints’) in Shuowen has 蹟 (NJK, also ‘footprint’) as being an alternative form. The current graph 跡 1592, considered ( Kangxi zidian ) to be a variant derived from 蹟 , consists of 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and by extension ‘walk’, with 亦 (NJK, originally ‘armpit’, now means ‘also’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘continue’, giving ‘footprints which continue’, and by extension ‘remains’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, in analyzing 迹 , Mizukami takes the associated sense of 亦 as ‘accumulate’, to give the original overall meaning ‘accumulated footprints’ (for 迹 ), which likewise gives ’remains, traces’ as an extended sense. DJ2009:v1:140; ZY2009:v4:1313; MS1995:v2:1288-89; OT1968:972. We suggest taking the right-hand element as ‘partly red’ 赤 48.

Examples:
  • 戸籍 [KOSEKI] - family register

  • 国籍 [KOKUSEKI] - nationality

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, combining with 耤 (CO, ‘plow a field’; see Note below) with associated sense taken either as i] ’pile up, accumulate, put together’ (Ogawa, Tōdō, Shirakawa), giving ‘bamboo (writing) strips bound together with leather’, or ii] ‘written texts’ (Katō); either way, the resultant meaning is ‘written texts’, originally on bamboo strips bound together. Note: the OBI form of 耤 is analysed as being either a pictograph of a farmer plowing a field, or 耒 699 (‘plow’, based on pictograph), with 昔 346 (olden times, past’), the latter element itself either as onomatopoeic for the sound of a plough as it digs up the soil, or as phonetic with associated sense ‘pile up’ (MS1995:v2:1054-6). TA1965:364-8; OT1968:759; SS1984:510; KJ1970:616. We suggest taking the modern form as ‘bamboo’ 58, ‘the past’ 昔 346, and multi-branched ‘tree’ 木 / 耒 73.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 出 36 (‘emerge, put out’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘collapse, hollow’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘short, inferior’ (Katō), either way giving ‘actions with the hand are inferior’, i.e. ‘clumsy’.

<b>窃</b>

Level: L1
Number: 1595

Examples:
  • 窃盗 [SETTŌ] - theft
  • 剽窃 [HYŌSETSU] - plagiarism
  • 窃取 [SESSHU] - theft

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 竊 . A difficult graph and analyses are diverse. The traditional form corresponds to the seal version above. Another seal form, listed by Katō, consists alternatively of’ 穴 860 ‘hole’, over 廿 , which appears to be a reinforcement of ‘hole, cave, cavity’, both these being over 米 220 ‘rice’, with overall meaning ‘rice stored in cave/hole’. This combines with (see Note below), which is taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘rob, plunder’, to give ‘plunder rice stored in cave’. Gu, alternatively, takes it as semantic and phonetic, interpreting the overall meaning as ‘bore into cave/hole and steal’. A further variation is offered by Qiu, who is supportive of taking as ‘rat makes a hole to bite things and steal rice’. By extension, ‘plunder; furtively’. The cumbersome traditional form 竊 (22 strokes) was already dropped in favor of the much simpler 窃 , in the first Jōyō Kanji List promulgated in 1923. Note: the meaning of is interpreted differently as ‘mythical creature with large head and tail’ (Mizukami), or ‘(type of) insect’ (Gu, Shirakawa), while the view referred to by Qiu appears to take as ‘rat’. KJ1970:619-20; OT1968:741; GY2008:948; SS1984:513; QX2000:230; MS1995:v2:960-61; KZ2007:1914. We suggest taking the modern form as ‘hole’ (if somewhat flattened) 穴 860 and ‘cut’ 切 173, and in accord with the probable item stolen, namely 米 220 ‘rice’.

Examples:
  • 摂取 [SESSHU] - intake
  • 摂政 [SESSHŌ] - regency/regent
  • 摂生 [SESSEI] - health care

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 攝 . Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 聶 (CO, ‘whisper’, based on reduplication of 耳 31 ‘ear’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either i] ‘bring together, collect’, giving ‘bring together, collect’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘lift up’, giving ‘lift/hold up’ (Katō). ‘Take control’ is considered to be an extended sense (Katō, Ogawa); and as Katō suggests, ‘act in place of’ is probably a loan use. Use of the lower right-hand element of four strokes in 摂 is not uncommon as a convenient reduplicating device used for abbreviation in popular forms in pre-modern Japanese texts. (see, for example, 渋 1463) OT1968:425; TA1965:800; KJ1970:623. We suggest taking the bottom right element as duplication, here specifically four.

Level: L1
Number: 1597

Examples:
  • 仙人 [SENNIN] - hermit, wizard
  • 酒仙 [SHUSEN] - hard drinker
  • 水仙 [SUISEN] - narcissus

Etymology: Seal form A ( 僊 ) ; seal form B ( 仙 ) . Seal form A consists of 亻 41 ‘person’, combining with 䙴 (see Note below) ‘raise up, move’; the explanation in Shuowen notes a connection with living a long time. Seal form B ( 仙 ), defined in Shuowen as ‘person in the mountains’, is considered to be a late, popular variant of 僊 , reflecting the practice of some individuals of going up into the mountains ( 山 26) to live and seek immortality (Gu). There are strong connections here with early stages of the Chinese philosophy or religion called Daoism. Note: another seal form includes two raised hands lifting something giving ‘lift up, lift up and move elsewhere’ (Mizukami, Shirakawa). Shirakawa takes the object being raised up specifically as a corpse. DJ2009:v2:663; GY2008:173; MS1995:v1:464-5; SS1984:515,520-21.

Examples:
  • 扇子 [SENSU] - (folding) fan
  • 扇風機 [SENPŪKI] - electric fan
  • 扇方 [ōgigata] - fan-shaped

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses differ in a minor way. In one view (Ogawa, Tōdō), consists of 戸 120 ‘gate, door’ and 羽 82 ‘wings’ to signify the leaves of a gate or door which open and close, in much the same way as wings of a bird or insect move up and down in flight. By extension, on the basis of the back and forth motion, ‘fan’. Alternatively, taken as 戸 combining with 羽 as an abbreviation of 翅 , NJK, another graph also meaning ‘wings’ (Katō; same overall meaning as in the preceding view); this latter analysis follows that put forward in Shuowen .

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 火 8 ‘fire’, and 前 177 (‘before, front’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘make complete’, giving ‘make complete with fire, roast, toast’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Gu, though, takes the original sense as to cook by heating with liquid added, probably on the basis of later commentary on Shuowen . OT1968:624; TA1965:569-72; DJ2009:v3:809; GY2008:1647.

Ogawa proposes taking ‘feel envy/jealousy’ as an extended sense. Note: consists of 氵 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 欠 496 (‘lack’; originally, pictograph of person kneeling with mouth open) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘saliva; drool’. Note also that 1603 has both aspects, envious and enviable. TA1965:533; OT1968:800; MS1995:v2:736-7.

Has 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and 戔 545 (‘fight, cut to pieces’; the traditional form depicts two opposing halberds, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘arrange’, giving ‘put one’s feet where others have trodden’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘accumulate, pile up’, giving ‘put one foot after another’ (Shirakawa). Either way, ‘tread, step’ is the resultant meaning; ‘take action’ appears to be an extended sense. QX2000:258; OT1968:972; TA1965:569-72; SS1984:523.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 戔 545 (halberds; ‘fight, cut’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘small, shallow’, thus ‘(thin) bamboo strips (for writing)’ (Ogawa); in broadly similar fashion, Shirakawa takes associated sense as ‘thin and placed on top’, and suggests original meaning may have been ‘title slip’ for a book cover. Bamboo strips were important as material for writing before invention of paper by the Chinese (what Tsien terms ‘true paper’ was invented in 105AD). OT1968:755; SS1984:524; TT1962:131-37.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken variously as ‘sink’ (Katō), ‘insert’ (Ogawa, Gu), or ‘enter confined space’ (Tōdō); despite differences, shared associated sense here is ‘enter into’, reflected in the overall meaning taken by these scholars, i.e. ‘pass through/under’, with ‘lie hidden’ as extended sense. Note: Shirakawa interprets as two hairpins over prayer receptacle to indicate secretly putting curse on someone. TA1965:807-11; KJ1970:564-5; OT1968:608; GY2008:1841; SS1984:525.

OT1968:1014; KJ1970:87. Suggest 覀 as ‘west’ 169, 己 as ‘self’ 866 and 大 as ‘big’ 56.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 纖 . Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 韱 (CO, ‘wild leek/chives/garlic’ [plant within the Allium genus]) taken in one analysis as both semantic and phonetic in the extended sense ‘small, fine’, giving ‘many fine threads’ (Ogawa). Another analysis prefers to treat 韱 alternatively as phonetic in function with associated sense ‘something sharp [= ‘blade’] thrusts in’, though this commentator (Tōdō) notes that in the graph 纖 the associated sense is ‘fine, slender’. Alternatively, ‘cut up fine’ is taken as the associated sense of 韱 . The overall original meaning of 繊 is ‘fine-textured silk/fabric’; this then became generalized to ‘fine, slender’. OT1968:790; TA1965:848-52. In addition to thread, we suggest taking as variant of 赤 48 ‘red’ plus one 一 , and 戈 as halberd (see 545).

The meaning ‘Zen’ (Buddhism) is a loan usage in which 禪 was borrowed for its sound value to represent a loanword into Chinese based on Sanskrit dhyāna ‘meditation’, but this graph may well have been selected for this role partly for semantic reasons also on account of its original meaning associated with ritual.

In considering the meaning ‘gradually’, Katō proposes a link with another homophonous graph listed in Shuowen , viz. 𧽯 , which has 走 179 ‘run’ (Qiu suggests the sense in early Chinese was ‘jog, trot’) as determinative, combining with 斬 as phonetic with associated meaning ‘move forward, advance’, to give ‘advance running at the front’; ‘gradually’ is then taken as an extended sense from ‘advance’. Another commentator proposes a more direct semantic evolution, giving a classical reference which supports the meaning ‘(rain) gradually soaks through’, and by extension ‘gradually’ (Shirakawa). DJ2009:v3:879,v1:134; ZY2009:v4:1297; QX2000:196; KJ1970:632-3; SS1984:532. We suggest taking the elements as water 氵 , 車 33 ‘vehicle’, and 斤 1233 ‘ax/chop/cleave’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 善 929 ‘good’ taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘make good with thread, repair’ (Katō); originally, no doubt, with reference to clothing, but then in a broader sense. Tōdō, in contrast, takes 善 here as phonetic with associated sense ‘more than ample’, giving ‘make good without skimping’. KJ1970:635; TA1965:528.

Examples:
  • 狙撃 [SOGEKI] - shooting, sniping

  • 空巣狙い [akisunerai] - sneak thief

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 犭 19 ‘dog’, and 且 1135 (‘furthermore’) as phonetic. The original meaning appears to have already been uncertain at the time when Shuowen was compiled, as that work explains it as referring to a type of monkey or possibly dog; associated sense of the phonetic is unclear. Gu takes as meaning a type of monkey which would lie in wait and then attack humans, and so ‘lie in wait’ is treated as an extended sense; this interpretation, though, is only tentative. Uncertain, therefore, whether ‘aim’ is an extended sense or a loan usage. DJ2009:v3:799; GY2008:684.

Has 阜 262 ( 阝 ) ‘hill, mound’, and 且 1135 (‘furthermore’; originally, possibly a pictograph of a layered object such as a tomb built with multiple layers of earth, or a cairn) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pile up’, giving ‘mountains piled up high on top of one another’ (Ogawa says ‘mountain road zigzags steeply’); by extension, ‘separate, obstruct’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 昔 346 (‘in olden times, past’) as phonetic with associated sense generally taken as ‘place, pile up’; several commentators regard ‘cast aside’ as an extended sense (Ogawa, Katō), though Tōdō does not support this. Schuessler includes both ‘place’ and ‘lay aside’ as meanings. OT1968:420; KJ1970:615; AS2007:638.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 米 220 ‘rice’, and 且 1135 (‘furthermore’/[piled objects]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘scatter’, giving ‘unrefined rice, nonglutinous rice’ (Ogawa; Gu also says ‘unre-fined rice’), or ii] ‘coarse’, giving ‘cracked rice’ (Katō). Either analysis still gives the extended sense ‘coarse’.OT1968:761; GY2008:1310; KJ1970:641.

Etymology: Seal ( 疏 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). 疎 evolved as popular variant of 疏 . 疏 itself has 432 (‘baby born in flow of amniotic fluid’), and / 疋 1574 (‘leg’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pass through’ &gt; ‘baby passes from mother’s body and is born’ (Katō, Gu). Ogawa takes as ‘flow passes through’. Modern form has 束 ‘bundle’ 561. ‘Shun, estranged, distant’ are extended meanings from parturition. KJ1970:584-5; GY2008:1522-3; OT1968:676.

  • 訴訟事件 [SOSHŌJIKEN] - lawsuit

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, with 斥 1586 (‘reject’). In one view, 斥 has semantic role, giving ‘offer verbal resistance’, hence ‘claim against’ (Tōdō). In another view 斥 is seen as phonetic with associated sense ‘go upstream, back’, thus ‘speak about something from base up’ (Ogawa). Despite some apparent divergence, both interpretations involve a process of resistance; Ogawa’s analysis could equally well be regarded as giving the overall meaning ‘go verbally against the tide’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The entry heading in Shuowen has 氵 42 ‘water’ as determinative, and notes 遡 as an alternative, which has 辶 / 辶 85 ‘go, walk’ instead. 朔 (see 1624 Note) is phonetic with associated sense ‘return to point of origin, go back’, thus ‘go upstream’, then generalized to ‘ go back’. Today, 溯 is a variant in Japanese. OT1968:600; GY1658-9. As with 1624, we suggest taking 屰 as ‘upside-down’ and 月 18 ‘moon’.

Examples:
  • 礎石 [SOSEKI] - foundation stone

  • 基礎的 [KISOTEKI] - elementary

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 石 47 ‘stone’, and 楚 (see Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘place beneath pillar’, giving ‘stone to place beneath pillar’ (Katō, Shirakawa), or ii] ‘beginning’, giving ‘stone which is placed first’ (Ogawa); in either case, overall meaning is ‘foundation stone’, then narrowed to ‘foundation’. Note: 楚 ‘thicket, thorny bush; name of ancient state in China’ has 林 79 ‘forest, trees’, and 1574 疋 (‘leg, foot’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘thicket’, giving ‘small shrubs, many small shrubs’ (Katō), or ii] ‘separated, scattered’, giving ‘brushwood, scattered branches’ (Tōdō; noted in Mizukami also). Schuessler gives meaning of 楚 as ‘thorny bush/tree’ (also given in Mizukami, as extended sense). ‘Chu’ as the name of an ancient Chinese state appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:585-6; SS1984:537; OT1968:716; MS1995:v1:680-81; AS2007:193. We suggest taking 林 as ‘two trees’ 木 73.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 莊 . Has 艹 53 ‘plants, grass,’, and 壯 / 壮 1628 ‘vigorous, flourishing’ as semantic and phonetic, thus ‘vegetation grows luxuriantly’ (Katō, Ogawa). Tōdō is in broad agreement, but adds connotation ‘well-ordered’. By extension, ‘countryside’ and then ‘country estate’. It is not clear whether ‘solemn, majestic’ is a loan usage or extended sense.

Number: 1630

Examples:
  • 捜査 [SŌSA] - investigation
  • 捜索 [SŌSAKU] - search
  • 捜し出す [sagashidasu] - seek out

Etymology: Seal ; traditional ( 捜 ) 搜 . Seal form has 扌 34 ‘hand’ and 叟 (NJK, ‘old man’), the latter probably a variant of 叜 , a graph which occurs in OBI onwards. The graph 叜 depicts a hand holding fire (a flaming torch) inside a house, giving the general overall meaning ‘search, look for’; the meaning ‘old man’ is a later loan usage of 叟 . At the seal stage, 扌 ‘hand’ was added as a determinative, and this is taken by Katō as signifying specifically ‘search by hand’; this may simply be a case of a determinative added redundantly to a graph already complete in terms of its constituent elements. OT1968:415; MS1995:v1:200-01; KJ1970:643. Suggest hand(s) 又 2003, 申 338 (‘expound’) as ‘stick’ 丨 and ‘field’ 田 63, or alternatively take 申 as symbol of piercing 丨 and ‘sun’ 日 66.

Examples:
  • 挿入 [SŌNYŪ] - insertion
  • 挿話 [SŌWA] - episode
  • 挿絵 [sashiE] - illustration

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 插 . Has 扌 34 ‘hand’ and CO 臿 as semantic and phonetic. 臿 is analysed in one view as a pounder ( 干 840 [‘dry; shield’; see Note below]) with a mortar ( 臼 see 677), giving ‘pierce’ as the original meaning (Tōdō). In another analysis, the element combining with 干 is not 臼 ‘mortar’ but 臼 ‘two hands’, though in similar vein the meaning is ‘pierce, pound’ (Ogawa); these two shapes quite resemble each other in shape in seal, but more so in block script, hence the potential for divergence in interpretation as well as confusion in writing. The later shapes and , with a slanted top stroke, are just minor variants of 臿 . Note: 干 is considered originally to depict a bifurcated branch; usually interpreted as a weapon for stabbing, but here appears to represent something slightly different but with a broadly similar domestic purpose, i.e. a pole with handles for piercing or pounding. TA1965:848-51; OT1968:423,834; MS1995:v1:446-7; GY2008:1404. We suggest taking as 千 49 ‘thousand’ and 日 66 ‘day’.

Examples:
  • 掃除機 [SŌJIKI] - vacuum cleaner
  • 一掃 [ISSŌ] - sweeping away
  • 掃き出す [hakidasu] - sweep out

Etymology: Seal ( 埽 ) . Shuowen has 埽 , comprising 土 64 ‘earth, soil’ and 帚 106 ‘broom’ (see) to give ‘sweep soil/dirt’, and this is generally regarded as the ancestral form of 掃 , which has 土 replaced by 扌 34 ‘hand’. The change is difficult to date, but it is clear that 掃 was already being used in Han times. Katō prefers to take 帚 in 掃 as serving not a semantic but phonetic role with associated sense ‘make good, put in order’, giving ‘adorn and clean by hand’. The first view noted here seems more persuasive. DJ2009:v3:1120; QX2000:202; OT1968:420; GY2008:1182; FC1974:v1:940-41.

Examples:

  • 曽祖母 [SŌSOBO] - great grandmother

Etymology: OBI ; bronze ; seal ; traditional 曾 . Originally, a pictograph of a sieve or steamer. The OBI form may be taken as depicting either, but at the bronze stage a pot – probably for making steam – was added as the bottom element, giving ‘steamer’ as the likely meaning. Subsequently adopted as a convenient means of representing several other homophones or near-homophones of abstract meaning (grammatical function words) in early Chinese such as ‘once in the past, formerly’. OT1968:478; GY2008:1507; MS1995:v1:634-5; WD1974:713-5. Suggest taking 丷 70 as ‘go away’, 田 63 ‘field’, and 日 66 ‘day’.

For the modern form, we suggest 又 2003 ‘hand’ and 申 338 (‘expound, talk’). OT1968:681; TA1965:206-12; GY2008:1747.

The latter element is taken by one commentator as semantic (in earlier sense ‘put together’) and phonetic, giving ‘object put together with wood’ (Gu). In Shuowen , 槽 is defined as ‘trough for animal feed’; sense later extended to other large wooden containers such as ‘barrel, vat’. Ogawa treats the element 曹 here as phonetic, though with associated sense unclear. GY2008:1786-7; SS1984:548; OT1968:523.

Note: 喿 consists of 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 品 , here representing not ‘mouths of people’ (original sense of 品 405 ‘goods’), but more specifically – based on the context with ‘tree’ – as ‘mouths of birds’, giving ‘birds singing/chirping in tree’, i.e. ‘noisy’. KJ1970:435; MS1995:v1:242-3. We suggest taking 品 as three boxes.

  • 大騒ぎ [ō sawagi] - uproar, chaos

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, and 蚤 NJK ‘flea’ acting in one view as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘scratch, claw at’, to give ‘horse rakes ground with hoof and is noisy/restless’. Gu, alternatively, takes 蚤 as signifying ‘restless’, to give either ‘horse is agitated’, or ‘groom horse with comb’. Sense then generalized to ‘disturbance, noise’. TA1965:212-4; OT1968:1128; GY2008:1529. For the modern ‘dotless’ form of flea in this graph, , take 又 as ‘hand’ 2003, and 虫 60 ‘insect’.

Alternatively, 足 as phonetic here is analyzed as having associated sense ‘shrink, make small’, giving ‘person of short stature’, and in this interpretation ‘urge’ is regarded as a loan usage (Katō).

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and at seal stage was 大 56 ‘big’ ( 太 181 ‘fat’ is later variant) as phonetic with associated sense seen in one view as ‘select’, giving ‘put in water and sort out’ (Ogawa); Qiu takes meaning to be ‘wash rice’. Another view takes original meaning as ‘bathe’, and ‘select by washing’ as extended sense (Gu). The sense ‘extravagant’ may be loan use of 汰 ‘select’ in place of 泰 1665 (‘big’, ‘extravagant’); alternatively, Qiu notes the view that use of 汰 for ‘extravagant’ may be abbreviated clerical script form of 泰 which happened to coincide in shape with 汰 as a separate graph meaning ‘select’. ‘Dismiss’ is an extended sense.

Examples:

  • 怠惰 [TAIDA] - laziness
  • 惰気 [DAKI] - indolence

Etymology: Seal : a late graph ( Shuowen ). At seal stage has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, with either 隋 (CO, ‘cut meat for offering’) (in the case of the fuller form 憜 ) or the abbreviated form as phonetic with associated sense ‘crumble, fall’, giving ‘motivation crumbles’ (Ogawa); Tōdō prefers to take as ‘the body slumps down’. The phonetic is alternatively taken with associated sense ‘languid, loose’, giving ‘languid feeling’ (Katō). These are quite minor differences of interpretation, all of which lead to the meaning ‘lazy’. OT1968:382; TA1965:544; KJ1970:417. We suggest taking elements as ‘feeling(s)’ 忄 , 左 24 as ‘left hand’, and 月 209 as ‘meat’.

Examples:
  • 駄馬 [DABA] - pack-horse
  • 駄物 [DAmono] - cheap goods
  • 無駄 [MUDA] - waste

Etymology: Seal ( 馱 ) ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, originally combined with 大 56 (‘big’) but later 太 181 (‘fat’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stack, pile up’, thus ‘load up a horse’, and by extension ‘load for a horse; pack-horse’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, Tōdō traces back to a word in early Chinese meaning ‘move/transport by pulling’. This word was originally written as 佗 , but when horses were used, it came to be written either as 駝 or 駄 ; 駝 later came to be used for ‘camel’, leaving 駄 for ‘load a horse; packhorse’. Pack-horses do not figure prominently in modern Japanese life, but this graph is still employed, almost always in words with a negative connotation, as reflected in ‘poor quality’.

Etymology: Seal ( 耏 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Entry heading in Shuowen has 耏 , but also notes 耐 as an alternative form. 耐 has 寸 920 ‘hand’ (here meaning ‘hold’), and 而 1447 (used for some grammatical function words; originally pictograph of beard) as phonetic with associated sense ‘can, able’, thus overall meaning ‘hold up, maintain’, and by extension ‘endure, bear’. DJ2009:v2:764; OT1968:286; TA1965:74-9. Suggest taking 而 as ‘rake’.

Etymology: Seal . Has 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat’ (here, in the sense ‘body’), and 台 183 (‘stand, platform’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘begin’, thus ‘child begins to form inside mother’, and hence ‘fetus; be pregnant’ (Mizukami, Tōdō), or ii] ‘indication, sign’, giving ‘sign of (new) body’, i.e. ‘fetus; be pregnant’ (Ogawa). ‘Womb’ is an extended sense. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent also. MS1995:v2:1074-5; TA1965:81; OT1968:819.

<b>泰</b>

Level: L1
Number: 1665

Examples:
  • 泰然 [TAIZEN] - composure
  • 安泰 [ANTAI] - peace
  • 泰西 [TAISEI] - the West, Occident

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations diverge considerably. In one approach, taken as 大 56 ‘big’ (but here representing ‘person [standing]’) combined with ‘both hands’ (stylized in block script to 廾 ) and 水 42 in the variant form 氺 , Gu interprets the role of the hands as being to sprinkle water, thus giving the overall meaning ‘bathe’. Another view treats the same three elements as having a different overall meaning, viz. ‘make waterway bigger and improve flow’, and takes ‘tranquil, calm’ as an extended sense (Ogawa). Yet another meaning put forward for these three elements is ‘help out/rescue someone who has fallen into water’ (Shirakawa). Alternatively, the element 大 here is regarded as phonetic in function with associated sense ’emerge, escape’, giving ‘let (something) slip through the fingers in water’ (e.g. rice, when washing it) or ‘put through sieve’ (Katō). Sometimes borrowed on the basis of its sound value – more commonly in older texts – to write TAI ‘Thailand’. Correct interpretation of this graph is elusive. GY2008:979; OT1968:566; SS1984:566; KJ1970:661. We suggest taking as two males 夫 601, and 氺 as ‘sprinkled water’

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ) The Shuowen xinfu has 帒 as the entry heading. This has 巾 1232 ‘cloth, fabric’ and 代 358 (‘replace’) as phonetic with associated meaning ‘wrap round, envelop’, giving ‘cloth bag for wrapping things in’; 袋 is also noted, though, as an alternative way of writing, with 衣 ‘garment’ 444 (here in sense ‘cloth’) replacing 巾 ‘cloth’ as determinative.

Note: bronze forms of 隶 have 又 2003 ‘hand’ reaching a tail (represented by a tail-like shape, taken as an abbrev of what later was to be written as 尾 1888 ‘tail’. MS1995:v2:1404-5,v1:406-08; OT1968:1004; TA1965:748-9. Take 隶 as 肀 hand seizing target, 氺 as (sweat) droplets.

Examples:
  • 代替 [DAITAI] - substitution
  • 両替 [RYŌ gae] - money changing
  • 取替え [torikae] - swapping

Etymology: Seal form A . A graph made difficult to analyse by the fact that while Shuowen has seal form A as the entry heading, it also goes on to give two other alternative forms; the meaning given in Shuowen is ‘one side goes down’. Seal form A itself consists of 竝 (traditional form of 並 977 ‘line up’; the top part of 替 is in error for 竝 ) over an element/graph which is considered to be one which is a homograph with 白 ‘white’, i.e. a different graph having the same shape as 白 69 ’white’. The seal element/graph concerned, corresponding to the lower part of , namely , ‘is of uncertain meaning. Greater clarity, albeit provisional, is found in one of these (let us call it ‘form B’) in Shuowen which has 曰 1048 ‘speak’ instead of 白 ; form B is taken in one view as consisting of 曰 ‘speak’, and 竝 as phonetic with associated meaning ‘stop, desist’, giving ‘say “stop/desist” ’, and by extension ‘change’ (Ogawa). The third seal form (‘form C’) in Shuowen has 曰 beneath 兟 (CO, ‘advance’); this may just have evolved as a popular variant, as is suggested in the 17 th century Zhengzitong . Unsurprisingly, the majority of commentators omit treatment of this challenging graph. MS1995:v2:896-7,980-82; DJ2009:v3:841,v2:696; OT1968:479; ZZ1671:v1:551-2. We suggest taking the upper part as two ‘males/husbands’ 夫 601, and 日 as ‘day’ 66.

Meaning later generalized to ‘hold up to the head’, and then senses such as ‘respectfully receive (by holding up to head)’. OT1968:397; KJ1970:663-4; GY2008:1920; DJ2009:v2:380.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 澤 . Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 睪 (see 1673 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ’entangled/linked,’ thus ‘land where aquatic plants are entangled, where lake and swampy land come together’, i.e. ‘swamp, marsh’. It is unclear as to how it acquired the meaning ‘benefit’, but possibly through ‘much [water]’. At one stage it also had a meaning ‘glisten’, which appears to have been a loan usage. OT1968:561 MS1995:v2:784-5; KJ1970:95. As with 1673, we suggest taking 尺 as 人 41 ‘person’ with backpack.

The first two commentators, by contrast, consider ‘open up, reclaim’ to be a loan usage. The minor meaning ‘rub’ may be extended from ‘clear’. KJ1970:613; TA1965:325-30; OT1968:408.

As this graph was later borrowed for other words too, to indicate clearly the meaning ‘agree’ the determinative 言 118 ‘words, speak’ was added, thus 諾 . Depending on approach taken, 諾 has been taken in one view as 言 with 若 ‘follow’ as semantic and phonetic (Ogawa), or alternatively as 言 with 若 just as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft, pliant’ (Mizukami, Katō), either way giving ‘agree’. Mizukami also lists proposed OBI form. MS1995:v2:1208-9; 1112-3; KJ1970:676; OT1968:935; AS2007:447-8; TA1965:357-8.

Examples:
  • 濁流 [DAKURYŪ] - turbid stream

  • 濁り江 [nigorie] - muddy creek

Etymology: Seal . Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 蜀 (‘caterpillar; Shu [name of ancient Chinese state]’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘dirty, polluted’, thus ‘dirty water’. Ogawa follows Shuowen , taking 濁 as original meaning river name, but Katō sees ‘dirty water’ as probable original meaning, later used to refer to dirty river. Note: 蜀 , originally in OBI as 𦉶 , showing insect with large eyes ( 罒 76) and long body ( 勹 ); at bronze stage, 虫 60 ‘insect’ was added as determinative.

Also used in early Chinese for some words of abstract meaning such as ‘only’ and ‘but’, probably loaned for its sound value, though Katō sees ‘only’ as extended sense based on use in senses such as ‘empty’ and ‘have nothing’.

Note: 兌 ( 兑 ) is typically taken as showing person 儿 41 with mouth 口 22 on top, signifying ‘call out, pray’, with ‘eight’ 八 / 丷 70 in its other meaning ‘disperse, out, away, off’; taken here as indicating either ‘words directed to the deities, pray’ by a shaman (Katō), or ‘manifestation of the spirit of the deities’ (Shirakawa). KJ1970:603; MS1995:v1:92-5; OT1968:823; SS1984:560; TA1965:548-9. Suggest ‘elder brother’ 兄 114, 丷 as ‘off’, plus ‘body’ 月 .

Note: at the OBI stage, the above graph for ‘friend’ was originally ‘shell currency on two strings’, written with a pictograph showing two strings of shell currency; this led to extended senses such as ‘pair; cluster together’, though these have become defunct in modern times. TA1965:155; OT1968:513; MS1995:v1:636-8. Take the two shells as 月 18 ‘months’.

<b>胆</b>

Level: L1
Number: 1688

Examples:
  • 胆嚢 [TANNŌ] - gall-bladder
  • 胆石 [TANSEKI] - gallstone
  • 落胆 [RAKUTAN] - discouragement

Etymology: Seal ( 膽 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 膽 ; 胆 is a later, post- Shuowen graph. 膽 consists of 肉 / 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, with 詹 (CO; ‘talkative’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘jar-shaped’, giving ‘gall-bladder’ (Katō), though ‘bag-shaped’ might be a better description (and see Note below). Alternatively, Ogawa takes the associated sense as ‘fill’, likewise giving ‘gall-bladder’. Shuowen defines 膽 as ‘organ which joins the liver’. 胆 is in origin a different graph from 膽 , listed in the Guangyun dictionary (early 11 th century) as originally having another meaning (possibly ‘saliva’), but 胆 was subsequently borrowed to write 膽 . Traditionally the gall-bladder was perceived to be the seat of courage, hence the extended use in that sense. Today, 胆 can be used in a general, non-technical way for either ‘gall-bladder’ or ‘liver’ (see Note following). Note: in modern Japanese, the medical term for gall-bladder is 胆嚢 TANNŌ ( 嚢 is ‘bag’ [NJK]) and that for liver is 肝臓 KANZŌ (see 肝 1142), but in popular everyday usage the native Japanese word kimo can refer to either, probably reflecting the close relationship between the two. Similarly, attempts are made to distinguish the use of 胆 and 肝 to write kimo meaning ‘liver/gall-bladder’ on the one hand and ‘courage’ on the other, but actual usage may not adhere to this. KJ1970:251; ZZ1671:v2:949 GY2008:896; TA1965:839; ZY2009:v3:1017,1040; OT1968:819. We suggest taking 旦 as ‘dawn’ 1687.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and (provisional meaning understood as ‘drought, starvation’: see also 265) with associated sense taken either as i] ‘suffer’, thus ‘become disheartened and sigh’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘swallow, unable to talk’, giving ‘make lamenting sound’ (Katō), either way giving ‘lament’. Basis for the minor meaning ‘admire’ is not clear. DJ2009:v1:119; OT1968:193; KJ1970:683. Take as ‘Han male’ (265).

Examples:

  • 端正 [TANSEI] - upright
  • 道端 [michibata] - roadside

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 立 77 ‘stand’, and 耑 ‘plant growing’ (see Note below), giving original meaning ‘upright’ (Qiu). ‘Edge, extremity’ are considered extended senses (Gu). Ogawa, alternatively, treats 耑 as phonetic with associated sense ‘flat’, giving ‘stand with good posture’. Note: OBI occur-rences of 耑 are taken in one view as a pictograph of a young plant putting out shoots above ground and showing roots below, giving the meaning ‘pointed shoot of a plant’, and by extension, ‘beginning; edge’. This view is set out in Mizukami, who also notes another interpretation of this graph (put forward by Tōdō) as representing edges of cloth hanging down, but this is not convincing. QX2000:266; MS1995:v2:1054-5; GY2008:1748; OT1968:747. Take 山 as ‘mountain’ 26 and 而 as rake.

Etymology: OBI ; seal ; traditional 彈 . The OBI form shows some variation, but more semantically-explicit occurrences have a small object, taken to be a stone for use as a projectile, inside a bow. Seal form has 弓 107 ‘bow’ and 單 / 単 569 (‘simple’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘round ball’, giving ‘bow to project stone missiles’; by extension, ‘hit; pull bowstring; play stringed instrument’. ‘Bounce’ and ‘spring’ would seem to be extended meanings.

Examples:
  • 白痴 [HAKUCHI] - idiot
  • 愚痴 [GUCHI] - idle complaint
  • 痴情 [CHIJŌ] - infatuation

Etymology: Seal ( 癡 ) ; 痴 is a late, post- Shuowen equivalent. The seal form has 疒 404 ‘sick-bed, sickness’ and 疑 848 (‘doubt, suspect’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘slow’, giving ‘illness of someone vague or lacking intelligence’ (Katō), hence ‘foolish’, or ii] ‘not advancing’, again giving ‘foolish’ (Ogawa). The popular form 痴 replaces 疑 with 知 186 ‘know’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘illness related to thinking’. Unfortunately, beyond saying that 痴 is a post-seal form it is difficult to give an indication of the period when it evolved. OT1968:680; KJ1970:691-2; DJ2009:v2:613.

Note: both Tōdō and Ogawa say ‘rice plant’ ( ine ), but 禾 is generally interpreted as ‘grain plant’, though Qiu prefers to take more specifically as ‘foxtail millet’, a grain plant grown at an early period in ancient China.

Etymology: Seal ; late, post- Shuowen form.

Gu also takes ‘original legal wife’ as original meaning. Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘stay in one place’, and seen to give original meaning as ‘woman’s respectful and compliant attitude’ (Katō); in this treatment, Katō regards senses such as ‘direct lineage’ as loan usages. The time when 啇 replaced 啻 in this graph is hard to establish. TA1965:462-3; OT1968:262; KJ1970:721; GY2008:769; MS1995:v1:238-9; ZY2009:v1:130. As 778/779, take 啇 as ‘funny tower’.

<b>酎</b>
Reading: CHŪ, sake
Meaning: sake, wine
Strokes: 10

Examples:
  • 焼酎 [SHŌCHŪ] - low-grade sake

Etymology: Seal . Has 酉 318 ‘wine’ (originally, pictograph of wine jar), and 寸 920 (‘hand’) as phonetic. The latter element is considered to be an abbreviation here; views differ as to what it is an abbreviation for. In one treatment, it is taken as abbreviation for 肘 (NJK, ‘elbow’) with associated sense ‘brew well’ (Mizukami, Ogawa). Other proposals for the unabbreviated phonetic are 時 151 (‘time’, Gu) and 丑 1454 (‘ox’, Shirakawa; see Note below). Despite some variation regarding the phonetic, commentators agree on the overall meaning ‘strong alcohol’; Schuessler says ‘spirits with sediment’. In Japan, it refers to lower-grade distilled alcohol with high alcohol content, made from sweet potato or rice wine lees. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. Note: 丑 was originally (OBI) a pictograph of a hand with fingers bent, about to grab hold of something, hence ‘grab with the hand’. It was subsequently borrowed to signify ‘Ox’ as the second of the Twelve Branches, used in traditional Chinese culture for such things as marking year dates on a recurrent cycle of sixty years. Shirakawa’s proposal is based on similarity in shape at the seal stage between 丑 and 寸 . MS1995:v2:1346-7,v1:6-7; OT1968:1026; GY2008:1014-15; AS2007:345.

Examples:
  • 鋳造 [CHŪZŌ] - casting
  • 鋳鉄 [CHŪTETSU] - cast iron
  • 鋳型 [igata] - mold

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 鑄 . Bronze forms vary somewhat, and all are different in structure from the seal form. The bronze form has hands – or more probably pincers – holding a container upside down over fire and metal, and so readily understood as ‘cast’ (Shirakawa); also includes an element which appears to be phonetic with associated sense ‘red’ (as of molten metal) (Katō).The seal form 鑄 consists of 金 16 ‘metal’, with 壽 (traditional form of 寿 1445 ‘long life’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘melt’, giving ‘melt and pour metal’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘extend everywhere’, giving ‘pour molten metal everywhere within a mold’ (Tōdō); either way, the overall meaning is ‘cast metal’. KJ1970:697; QX2000:89; AS2007:627; SS1984:596; OT1968:1044; TA1965:179-83.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 兆 573 (‘sign, omen’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘leap up’, thus ‘raise up high with hands’, giving ‘challenge, confront’ (Ogawa), presumably taking raised hands as confrontational posture. Alternatively, 兆 here is taken as associated sense ‘divide in two, open’ (Tōdō), though how this relates to ‘challenge’ is not clear. OT1968:414; TA1965:243-4.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 彡 115, a determinative taken to signify ‘decorative feathers/features’, combined with 周 532 ‘encircle, around’, taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘surround with decorative carving’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). In another analysis, 周 is taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘knife’, giving ‘fashion decorative elements with knife’ (Katō); based on a short passage in Lun Yu ( The Analects of Confucius ), Katō maintains that the original meaning of 彫 is ‘carve wood with knife’.

  • 釣銭 [tsuriSEN] - change (coin)

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 勺 ‘scoop up, catch’ (see Note below) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘scoop up/catch (fish)’. Alternatively, 勺 is taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull out’, but still giving essentially the same meaning, in this view ‘pull fish out of water’ (Tōdō). It is unclear as to how 釣 came to mean ‘monetary change’. Note: 勺 was originally (OBI stage) a pictograph of a scoop or ladle, giving ‘scoop up’ as an extended sense. It was removed as an independent graph from the Jōyō kanji List in 2010. OT1968:1037; GY2008:639; TA1965:247-8; MS1995:v1:146-7.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). In one analysis, has 貝 10 ‘shell currency, valuables’, and 占 1598 (‘divination’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘store, put aside’, thus ‘give as security’ as the early meaning (Ogawa). In Shirakawa’s view, however, this represents the later meaning as given in Shuowen xinfu . On the basis of earlier usage, he takes the original meaning as ‘add to, supplement’, and points out that in the Tang Dynasty when Imperial edicts were amended this was referred to in Chinese as 貼黄 ( tie huang ) ‘attach/stick yellow [paper]’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and 兆 573 (‘sign, omen’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘leap up’, thus ‘dance upwards’ (Ogawa). Shirakawa considers 兆 also has a semantic function here, linking it to the cracks which ran along a turtle shell when heated as part of the divination process employed in Shang times (see 573). OT1968:972; SS1984:604; GY2008:1596.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 徵 . Has as abbrev of 微 1890 ‘faint, indistinct’, with (‘stand straight/tall; sign, indication’; see Note below) with associated sense taken in one view as ‘show’, thus ‘give hint/subtle indication of will’ (Katō, Ogawa), and ‘sign, indication’ as extended sense. Shirakawa looks to attribute a ritualistic, shamanist-orientated derivation to this graph. Mizukami lists proposed bronze equivalents also. Note: Tōdō, however, takes as 王 5 ‘ruler’, and as phonetic with associated sense ‘raise up’, thus ‘ruler elevates/promotes’. Most scholars, though, regard as originally , not 王 . ‘Summon’, ‘collect’ seem extended senses. DJ2009:v2:669; KJ1970:803-04; MS1995:v1:490-92; OT1968:355; TA1965:93-5; SS1984:604-5.

Examples:
  • 清澄 [SEICHŌ] - clear, limpid

Etymology: Seal ; 登 is not in Shuowen form (see below). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and (Shirakawa treats as abbrev of 徴 1722 ‘sign; summon’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘go through’, thus ‘water is see-through/clear’ (Katō). Ogawa, though, takes the phonetic 登 in 澄 as having associated sense ‘gradually becomes clear’, thus ‘cloudy water becomes clear’. Katō sees 澄 as a popular form, but Shirakawa rejects this proposed lower status on the grounds that 澄 was already used in Han epitaphs. 澄 best seen as alternative form of 澂 that later became predominant. DJ2009:v3:899; KJ1970:733; OT1968:608; SS1984:606. Use 登 382 ‘climb’.

  • 懲悪 [CHŌAKU] - punishing evil

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 徵 1722 ‘sign’ as upper element. Modern form 心 164 ‘heart, mind’, with 徴 as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘change, renew’, thus ‘reform’ (Katō), or ii] ‘clarify’, giving ‘find out past wrongs/transgressions’ (Ogawa). The latter analysis leads to ‘chastise’ as extended sense. Kangxi zidian retains the form with (‘stand up straight/tall, tower above; sign’) as phonetic, but in the modern period this has been modified to 王 5 ‘king’, on the basis of the latter being a similarly-shaped element which is commonly occurrent. KJ1970:703; OT1968:390.

Etymology: Seal . Has 玉 15 ‘jade, precious stone, jewel’, and 㐱 (‘thick hair’; see note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘be full/complete, replenish’, giving ‘fine jade/precious stone without blemish’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘free from impurity’, giving ‘fine jade/precious stone of solid (pure) colour’ (noted in Mizukami together with i] above). Mizukami gives proposed OBI equivalents which have 貝 10 ‘shell currency’ together with an enclosing element of uncertain meaning. Note: OBI and bronze occurrences of 㐱 have 人 41 ‘person’ combined with 彡 (see 115, 517), an element which is interpreted not in its typical determinative meaning ‘decorative feathers/features’ but as a shape representing thick human hair. Note also that as a determinative jade 玉 almost always drops its dot. OT1968:655; MS1995:v2:854-5; GY2008:178-9; BK1957:123-4. We suggest taking top right as ‘person’ 人 41, and 彡 as scratches.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 隹 324 (‘short-tailed bird, bird’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘break’ (Ogawa), giving ‘mallet’. In modern Japanese, refers to a variety of tree (J. shii [members of beech family including Castanopsis sieboldii ]). This may be loan usage of 椎 based on its SJ ( on ) pronunciation (modern values: TSUI , SUI ). ‘Backbone’ would seem to be extended sense. Used for its sound value in writing 椎茸 ‘ shiitake mushroom ( Lentinus edodes )’. OT1968:512; SS1984:612; GY2008:1388.

Number: 1739

Examples:
  • 爪切り [tsumekiri] - nail clippers
  • 爪先 [tsumasaki] - tip-toe
  • 爪痕 [tsumeato] - a scratch

Etymology: Originally (OBI) a pictograph. Taken in one interpretation as depicting either claws or talons (Shirakawa), or in another as a human hand with fingers apart, poised to grasp something (Mizukami, Gu, Ogawa). Mizukami lists several proposed OBI forms, and if these are accepted then they do seem to represent a hand rather than a claw. ‘Hand’ is often the more appropriate sense in compound graphs, where 爪 is usually represented in the modified shape 爫 (see e.g. 採 709 ‘take, gather’). The latter two commentators consider ‘claw, talon’ etc. to be borrowed usage, but it seems better to take as extended sense (if ‘hand’ is considered to be what is originally depicted).

Regarding i] above, it is worth noting that cranes are very vocal birds, and at least some varieties have cries which carry a long distance. Note: 隺 is explained in Shuowen as ‘bird ( 隹 ) rising up and wanting to go through a boundary’. DJ2009:v2:433; OT1968:1155; SS1984:110; TA1965:264-6; MS1995:v1:106-7; BK1957:287.

Etymology: Seal form: . Traditional form has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and 𡈼 1722 (‘stand up straight/tall; sign, indication’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘extend in a straight/direct manner, show’, giving ‘show, express clearly in words’. Note: the lower element 𡈼 is given in Mizukami’s entry heading for 呈 as 壬 (‘spinning spool’), but is clearly an error; this may have crept in at the typesetting stage. Modern computer fonts for Japanese (and Chinese) typically do not support the 𡈼 / 壬 distinction; they support only the latter. (See Appendix.) OT1968:173; MS1995:v1:220-21,262-3,282-3; KJ1970:708-9.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and CO 氐 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit/strike against’, thus ‘push aside with hand’; by extension, ‘resist’. In minor variation of interpretation, Tōdō notes 抵 is used in (unspecified) classical Chinese texts with slightly different meaning ‘reach up to/against’. Note: fuller OBI forms corresponding to 氐 have an element interpreted as a depiction of hillocks, with a horizontal stroke underneath, thus ‘flat land at foot of hillocks’ (Mizukami). KJ1970:713; OT1968:408-09; TA1965:748; MS1995:724-6. Take 氐 as ‘clan’ 氏 522 with 一 1 as bottom line.

Mizukami, who gives proposed bronze equivalent, considers ‘stay’ to be later associated sense, and that before that it was ‘stand upright’, thus ‘building which stands upright’. KJ1970:715; OT1968:38; MS1995:v1:38-9. Take 丁 as ‘nail’ 367.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

The meaning ‘make clear, clarify’ for 諦 was carried over into pre-modern Japanese as akiramu ; following this, 諦 was later borrowed for its sound value to represent a separate verb akiramu meaning ‘give up (the idea, etc.), resign oneself to’, leading to modern akirameru .

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 尼 1819 (‘nun, priestess’) as phonetic. Katō treats the associated sense as unclear, on the basis that 泥 denotes a river name. This is the explanation in Shuowen , but another commentator (Ogawa) takes 尼 as phonetic with associated sense ‘be sticky’, giving ‘muddy water, mud’; this view is supported by Shirakawa, who takes the original meaning to be not a river name but ‘mud’.

KJ1970:721; OT1968:604-05; TA1965:470-73. As with 1756, we suggest taking 啇 as ‘odd’ tower (see also 高 132).

We suggest taking it as 弱 ‘weak’ 154. OT1968:601; SS1984:1625; GY2008:1660.

Etymology: Seal . Has 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, and 折 551 (‘bend, break’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut with ax’ and by extension ‘clearly decide’, giving ‘make (appropriate) judgement’, as when decisively cutting trees with ax (Mizukami, Ogawa). By contrast, Gu feels 悊 may be ancestral form (bronze) of 哲 , with 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ as determinative and not 口 . Mizukami takes 悊 as 心 combined with 折 as phonetic (same associated sense as above), giving ‘decide clearly in one’s mind’; ‘respect’, ‘find out, clear, perceive, comprehend, wise’ are treated as loan senses. Mizukami is not as confident, though, that 悊 is the ancestral form of 哲 , suggesting rather that 悊 might just have served sometimes as a loan writing in place of 哲 . Shuowen has 哲 in the main heading, with 悊 noted as an alternative form. DJ2009:v1:109; MS1995:v1:232-3,510-12; OT1968:183; GY2008:1027.

Examples:
  • 添加 [TENKA] - annex, addition

  • 添え木 [soegi] - splint, brace

Etymology: Seal ( 沾 ): . The ancestral form of 添 is considered to be 沾 , which consists of 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’, combined with 占 1598 (‘perform divination; occupy’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view either as ‘supply beyond needs’, giving ‘overflow’ (Katō), or ii] ‘adhere, stay’, giving ‘become moist/wet’ (Ogawa); Shirakawa diverges somewhat, treating the overall meaning as ‘add to/increase items of food’, though this does not explain the presence of the element 水 . Another different analysis of 沾 takes 占 as having the associated sense ‘stay at one spot/place’, giving ‘cause/drop a stain’ (Tōdō) At a later stage (post- Shuowen ), 沾 sometimes came to be written instead as 添 (see Note below) in popular usage, and the latter form subsequently became predominant for the sense ‘add’. Katō regards ‘add’ as an extended sense from ‘overflow, full of water’. Note: in relation to 沾 , 添 replaces the phonetic element 占 here with 忝 (CO; ‘feel shame’) as phonetic, both have the same sound value in early Chinese. KJ1970:725-6; OT1968:567; GY2008:1315; SS1984:629-30; TA1965:836-8. We suggest taking 夭 as a ‘big man’ 大 56 and as an odd variant of 忄 / 心 164 ‘heart/feelings’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘soil, ground’, with 眞 341 (traditional form of 真 ‘truth, essence’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘block, fill up’, thus ‘fill/block with earth’. This is one of several proposed etymologies for 眞 (see 341). Shirakawa offers a different view, taking 眞 in the sense representing the main interpretation, i.e ‘person upside down’ (again, see 341), thus overall original meaning for 塡 as ‘ritually bury upside-down a dead person who met unfortunate end (through disaster, murder, etc.)’. According to Shirakawa, this ritual was performed to bring repose to the soul of such a person; in the latter view, ‘fill up, block’ is a generalized sense. Note modern simplified form 填 .

Etymology: Seal ( ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views diverge. One view treats as 殳 ‘strike’ 170 (see Note below), with left hand part of (explained below) taken as phonetic, serving as onomatopoeic for the sound of hitting something, to give ‘hit something and make noise’ (Katō, Ogawa). This view is based on traditional explanation in Shuowen . Tōdō takes a different view, following instead information from the Han Dynasty character textbook Jijiupian , which explains as ‘hit buttocks of criminal with bamboo whip’. In this view, left hand part of represents a pair of buttocks seated on a stand or similar This seems a reasonable assessment of the seal form, and one which results in the more specific overall meaning for . Later came to be used to represent other words which were homophones or near-homo-phones such as ‘rear (of army)’ (noted by Schuessler) and ‘heavy foundations’. Based on the latter sense, came to be used by further extension for big buildings with heavy foundations such as palaces (Tōdō says this meaning evolved from the Qin Dynasty onwards). In texts in the clerical script, examples can be found of written in what was then a variant form, i.e. 殿 ; over time, this came to be the norm for this graph. Note: 殳 has 又 2003 ‘hand’ holding 几 , a very stylized version of what in OBI occur-rences of 殳 is a depiction of halberd or similar. KJ1970:189-90; OT1968:547; TA1965:676-82; SK1984:431; MS1995:v1:408-10,712-14; AS2007:211. Take 尸 as slumped person, and 共 ‘together’ 484.

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Originally (OBI), picto-graph of scoop or ladle; probably at that stage the same graph as 升 1485 (q.v.).

Here, latter is usually treated as phonetic, with associated sense taken as i] ‘escape (stealthily)’, leading to generalized meaning ‘escape’ (Katō), ii] ‘leap up’, giving ‘leap up and escape’ (Shirakawa), or iii] ‘split in two, open’, thus ‘(two entities) move so as to split into two’, and ‘escape’ (Tōdō). Ogawa, however, takes 兆 here as both semantic and phonetic with a meaning ‘move away’, but this seems a rather extreme interpretation of the original meaning of 兆 ‘sign, omen’, presumably based on a perception of motion when a crack is formed. Mizukami also lists proposed OBI and bronze forms. KJ1970:703; SS1984:643; TA1965:243; MS1995:v2:1290-91.

  • 倒置 [TŌCHI] - inversion

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (late version of Shuowen ). Has 到 1775 ‘reach, arrive’ (originally showing arrow coming to rest upside-down), with 亻 41 ‘person’ added as determinative (in one view) to indicate clearly the meaning ‘fall over’ (originally written as 到 ) (Ogawa; Gu also). Shirakawa prefers to take original meaning of 倒 as ‘meet, greet’, giving ‘meet/greet someone who has arrived’; he does not indicate the relationship to ‘fall over’. The former analysis is probably the one to follow. OT1968:71; GY2008:1074-5; SS1984:643.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 兆 573 (‘sign, omen’, initially pictograph of cracks formed on turtle shell or similar in divination), the latter element taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘tree with fruit stones which split in two’, i.e. ‘peach’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Alternatively, 兆 is treated here by Katō just as phonetic, with associated sense ‘beginning’, giving ‘tree with fruit used at beginning of pregnancy’, reflecting the popularity of this fruit in ancient times among pregnant women and an association with procreation. (Cf. the Japanese legend of Momotarō, the Peach Boy.) OT1968:506; TA1965:243-4; KJ1970:703.

Level: L2
Number: 1783

Examples:
  • 盗用 [TŌYŌ] - appropriation
  • 強盗 [GŌTŌ] - robbery
  • 盗人 [nusubito*] - thief

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 盜 . Consists of CO ‘drool saliva’ (see Note below), combined with 皿 300 ‘bowl, dish’, interpreted in one view as giving ‘drool saliva over bowl of food, wanting to take it’ (Mizukami, Katō); by extension, ‘(quietly) take, steal’. Ogawa interprets the original sense of 盜 slightly differently as ‘look at food in another’s bowl and feel envious’, but still arrives at the same extended sense as above. Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents for 盗 . Note: is comprised of 氵 ‘water, liquid’, combined with 欠 496 (originally, depiction of person with mouth wide open; ‘lack; gap’), hence the meaning ‘drool saliva’. MS1995:v2:906-7; KJ1970:669; OT1968:532. We suggest taking the modern upper part of 1783 as ‘next’ 次 308.

Examples:
  • 陶器 [TŌKI] - ceramic ware
  • 陶然 [TŌZEN] - happily drunk
  • 陶冶 [TŌYA] - training, education

Etymology: Seal . Consists of 阜 / 阝 262 ‘hill, piled-up earth’, with 匋 (‘bake earthenware’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘(pile up) hill/mountain on top of a hill/mountain’, giving overall sense ‘piled-up hills’ (Ogawa) or ‘name of double-layered mountain’ (Katō). Alternatively, 匋 is taken with associated sense ‘spread evenly’, giving overall meaning for 陶 as ‘pound piled-up earth and make firm’ (Tōdō). Use of 陶 in the sense ‘earthenware, pottery’ appears to be a loan use. It is unclear as to the acquisition of very minor meanings, namely ‘educate, train’ (which may be an extended meaning to train potters) and ‘happy’. (See example words.) Note: 匋 is comprised of 缶 1141 ‘(earthenware) pot’, combined with 勹 611 ‘enclose’; the latter element is taken to be an abbreviation for i] 炮 NJK ‘(lightly) roast’, giving the overall meaning ‘bake earthenware; earthenware’ (noted in Mizukami), or ii] as meaning ‘spread evenly all across mold’, giving ‘knead evenly and make earthenware’ (Tōdō). MS1995:v1:150-51,144-6; OT1968:1070; KJ1970:667-8; TA1965:179-83. We suggest taking 缶 as ‘pot’, 勹 as ‘enclosed’, and 阝 as ‘piled up earth’.

Number: 1785

Examples:
  • 石塔 [SEKITŌ] - tombstone
  • 卒塔婆 [SOTŌBA*] - stupa
  • 五重塔 [GOJŪTŌ] - five-storied pagoda

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). This graph appears to have been devised in the course of the monumental task of translating the Buddhist canon from Sanskrit into Chinese. As part of this process, many Sanskrit Buddhist terms were carried across into Chinese as loanwords by adapting them to the sound system of Chinese, very often also with abbreviation of the original Sanskrit. In this case, Sanskrit stūpa (‘Buddhist shrine’) was reduced to just one syllable and represented by 塔 , consisting of 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, with 荅 (CO, original meaning ‘red beans’) as phonetic to represent the Chinese approximation of the Sanskrit syllable tū in stūpa . Note: according to Katō, these Buddhist shrines were originally built using stone, tiles, and earth, which would help explain use of 土 as the determinative in 塔 , but he suggests there was also a semantic link between 塔 and 堂 584 ‘hall, temple’ on the one hand and 墳 1930 ‘mound, burial mound’ on the other. As is often the case, once loanwords have been adopted into a language, their meaning can change; in this case, changing to encompass a different shape such as a pagoda, and the use of wood as one of the construction materials. KJ1970:666-7; SS1984:647,645; OT1968:221. We suggest taking 荅 as 艹 53 ‘plant’, and 合 134 ‘join, put together’, along with 土 ‘earth’ 64.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 58 ‘bamboo’, combined with 同 204 (‘same’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘penetrate, pierce; hollow’, giving ‘bamboo tube (with joint obstructions removed)’. Katō prefers to take it as ‘flute’, though this is probably a specialized sense. OT1968:751; TA1965:286-9; AS2007:499-500; KJ1970:73.

Examples:
  • 踏破 [TŌHA] - tramp, travel on foot
  • 足踏み [ashibumi] - step, tread, stalemate
  • 踏み込む [fumikomu] - step into

Etymology: Seal ( 蹋 ) . The graph 踏 is a popular equivalent of later origin which rose to predominance. The seal form consists of 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, combined with 𦐇 (CO; later replaced by 沓 ) (see Notes below) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘accumulate’, giving ‘accumulate stepping action, tread/trample on’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘attach’, giving ‘foot is firmly planted on the ground’, i.e. ‘tread, stamp’ (Katō). Note 1: 𦐇 is defined in Shuowen as ‘fly vigorously’, i.e. fly with vigorous wing movements. Gu, though, maintains that the original meaning is rather ‘wings spread ready for flight’. Note 2: the seal form of 沓 shows that the lower element is not 日 66 ‘sun, day’, but 曰 1048 ‘speak’, which combines with 水 42 ‘water’, giving ‘talk eloquently’, i.e. words like flowing water. OT1968:974,478; TA1965:796-8,833; GY2008:1041,769; KJ1970:669; DJ2009:v1:170,297. We suggest taking the lower right element as ‘sun’.

Later, determinative changed from 鬥 to 門 ‘gate’ (seemingly a common transition in clerical script; also, 斲 was replaced by as phonetic (same associated sense), probably at block script stage. Note: 斲 has 斤 1233 ‘ax’, with (CO; ‘large wine vessel’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut, strike, shave off’ (Mizukami). originally (seal form) shows wine vessel in profile.

Alternatively, 同 is taken here with associated sense ‘tube, hollow’, giving ‘cave where water has entered deep into’ (Shirakawa). OT1968:576; TA1965:286-9; SS1984:655.

Etymology: Seal ( 柰 ) . Seal stage is usually taken as the oldest, having 木 73 ‘tree, wood’ with 示 723 (‘show’, originally pictograph of offering table/altar) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Shuowen denotes this as a type of fruit tree, possibly a variety of apple. The change to the shape with 大 56 ‘big’ as top element instead of 木 seems to have become established at clerical script stage. Interrogative senses such as ‘how?’ should be seen as loan usages. Gu alone, it seems, proposes an OBI equivalent. DJ2009:v2:449; OT1968:247; SS1984:666; SK1984:192; WD1974:536; GY2008:584-5.

  • 比丘尼 [BIKUNI*] - Buddhist nun

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses diverge. One view takes 尸 as ‘person slumped/lying down, corpse’ 256, but here ‘lame person’, with 匕 (‘bent leg/ladle’ [see Appendix]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, giving ‘lame person stops’ (Katō). In another view, 尸 is taken as meaning just ‘person’, with 匕 as semantic, serving as abbreviation of 比 792 (originally, depiction of two people lined up; ‘compare’), giving ‘line up’ (Tōdō). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes 尼 as depicting one person leaning against another, giving ‘intimate’. The meaning ‘nun’ reflects the use of 尼 for its sound value to write the final syllable of a loanword deriving from Sanskrit bhiksunī ‘nun’. KJ1970:694; TA1965:759-61; SS1984:668-9. Suggest taking 匕 as sitting figure.

In another interpretation, associated sense of 巴 here is taken as ‘adhere evenly and thinly’, thus ‘apply hand flat against’, but this gives slightly different hand action and meaning, as Tōdō acknowledges. Use as a counter meaning ‘armful, bundle’ is extended sense. OT1968:404; GY2008:411; MS1995:v1:432-3; TA1965:435-8. Take 巴 as snake.

Examples:
  • 薄着 [usugi] - light clothes

  • 薄皮 [usukawa] - thin skin

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). 艹 53 ‘plants’, with 溥 (CO,‘watery expanse; vast’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘spread over/cover widely’, thus ‘grassy plain’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘get close’, thus ‘densely growing plants’ (Mizukawa, Katō). ‘Thin’ is a loan usage. Note: right-hand part of the phonetic 溥 here is 尃 , not to be confused with similarly-shaped 専 925 (‘exclusive, sole’), of which the traditional form 專 is a little more distinctive in shape. 溥 has 氵 42 ‘water’ with 尃 , the latter taken in one view as ‘field of plant seedlings’, and by extension ‘plant out seedlings’; sense then generalized to ‘spread’ (Gu), though Shirakawa sees it as sapling roots being trussed up/bound. GY2008:1653,1012; KJ1970:772-3; OT1968:874; MS1995:v1:256-8,394-5; SS1984:693; AS2007:173. Suggest using ‘sole,’ 専 (but ‘not quite right’/‘almost’) to represent 尃 , plus water 氵 and plants 艹 .

  • 砂漠 [SABAKU] - desert

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, with 莫 ‘not’ (and other negative senses)’ (original way of writing 暮 982 ‘sunset’, q.v.), taken in one view (Gu) as semantic and phonetic, thus ‘lack of water’ and hence ‘desert’. In another view 莫 is taken as phonetic only with associated sense ‘vast, expansive’ (Shirakawa), though combined with 氵 this would seemingly lead to a meaning opposite to that proposed by Gu. GY2008:1652; SS1984:693; WD1974:525-6. Take as water 氵 42, plants 艹 53, ‘sun’ 日 66, and ‘big’ 大 56.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, with 尃 (CO, ‘field of plant seedlings’, or ‘truss up sapling roots’; see 1849 Note). 尃 is treated as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘stick, attach’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘bind’ (Shirakawa, Gu), both giving overall meaning ‘bind with thread/cord’. Note: if 尃 is seen as ‘truss up sapling roots’, its role here is both semantic and phonetic. OT1968:788; SS1984:693; GY2008:1674. As in 1849 (q.v.) take ‘almost sole’.

  • 原爆 [GENBAKU] - atom bomb

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 火 8 ‘fire’, with 暴 814 (‘violence’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘flames fly’, giving ‘fireworks burst open’ (Ogawa). In similar vein, Tōdō tends towards ‘sparks (from fire) fly’ as the original associated sense, and sees ‘burn and burst open’ as the extended meaning. Another view sees 暴 as onomatopoeic, and the graph 爆 is taken as representing sound of such things as firewood or bamboo crackling or popping while burning (Katō; Shirakawa is also of this view). By extension, ‘explode’. OT1968:629; TA1965:278; KJ1970:777-8; SS1984:694.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, with 314 者 / 者 ‘person’. 者 is taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘pick up’, giving ‘(pieces of) bamboo for picking up food’ (Katō, Ogawa). Gu, however, takes 者 as both semantic and phonetic, linking it to the original meaning indicated by the bronze form, which has firewood projecting up out of a container. Gu thus takes the original meaning of 箸 as ‘bamboo fire brand/torch’, and treats the meaning ‘chopsticks’ given in Shuowen as an extended sense. In modern times the dot has tended to disappear, as is the case with 者 . OT1968:756; KJ1970:495; GY2008:1727.

Tōdō also gives an alternative analysis for 肌 , taking 几 as phonetic with associated sense ‘small, detailed’, giving ‘fine-textured skin’. TA1965:784-7,695-8; OT1968:815.

Etymology: Seal . Has 髟 ‘long hair’ (NJK; see Note 1 below), with 犮 (CO, ‘dog leaps up’ [Ogawa] or ‘dog wags tail’ [Katō]; see Note 2 below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘grow, emerge’, giving ‘hair grows’(Ogawa, Katō), or ii] ‘cover’, giving ‘hair covering the head’ (Tōdō). Mizukami also notes a view that may be termed a variation of i] above, with associated sense ‘spring up, open in random way’, giving ‘hair which springs up in random way’. Mizukami also lists proposed bronze equivalents. Note 1: 髟 is taken as left hand side 镸 189 ‘long hair/person with long hair’, combined with 彡 115 as meaning ‘complete, full/abundant’, giving ‘hair is full/abundant’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Note 2: Traditional form of 髪 has 犮 as lower element, now regularized in shape in a way that corresponds to 友 234 (‘friend’). MS1995:v2:1476-8; OT1968:1136; KJ1970:370; SS1984:725; AS2007:166.

It is unclear as to how other meanings came about. Note 1: traditional form of 抜 has 犮 as right-hand element, now regularized in shape in a way which corresponds to 友 234 (‘friend’). Note 2: in early Chinese writing, the causative was often left unmarked, needing to be inferred from context. Take 友 as ‘friend’. KJ1970:371; OT1968:404; TA1968:647-51.

Shirakawa offers an alternative minority view, taking the associated sense as ‘scramble up’, and relates the overall meaning to a ladder providing a link with the deities. 坂 394, a variant form of later provenance which substitutes 土 64 ‘earth, ground’ as determinative, is listed in the 11 th century Jiyun dictionary. See also 坂 394. GY2008:344,368; TA1965:658-61; KJ1970:787; SS1984:700; OT1968:213.

Examples:
  • 一般 [IPPAN] - general(ly)

  • 万般 [BANPAN] - all, everything

Etymology: OBI ; seal . Views diverge. One treats as 攴 ‘hit with whip/stick’ 112, with a second element similar in shape to 井 1575 (‘well’, taken as ‘frame to enclose soil’, thus ‘flatten earth and make firm’ (Ogawa). In this view, senses such as ‘move’ are seen as loan uses. Another view (Katō) accepts variation in shape in OBI and bronze forms, but still feels that appropriate interpretation is 舟 1450 ‘boat’, combined with 殳 170, a determinative usually meaning ‘strike with weapon’. Originally, 殳 depicts hand holding a weapon (possibly halberd), but is taken here by Katō as pole used to propel boat, giving overall meaning ‘move boat round, go round by boat’; ‘move, transport, carry’ may be taken as extended senses in this analysis. Another view has the element later rendered as 舟 as meaning 盤 1877 ‘bowl’, and together with 殳 in sense ‘hit with stick’ is taken as ‘make a bowl’ (Gu; Shirakawa also notes as possible interpretation). KJ1970:783; GY2008:1087; MS1995:v2:1100-01,v1:564-5,712-3; OT1968:838; SS1984:701-2.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally written 辬 , comprising 文 72 ‘pattern’, with 辡 (‘be in dispute’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘mix’, giving ‘mottled pattern/colors’. Later, the phonetic element was changed from 辡 to 玨 (shortened form of 珏 (‘two sets of jade discs’: see 15). Note: 辡 has 辛 1535 (‘sharp’) duplicated; the original meaning of 辛 being ‘large tattooing needle’, used on foreheads of criminals and slaves to mark ownership. Shuowen defines 辡 as ‘criminals in dispute’. Distinguish from 班 970. GY2008:1360; ZY2009:v3:729,v4:1338; OT1968:447.

  • 煩労 [HANRŌ] - trouble, pains

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, with 火 8 ‘fire’. In one analysis the 火 element is taken as ‘fever’, giving ‘have fever and headache’, and by extension ‘suffer, trouble’ (Ogawa). Another scholar (Tōdō) also takes original meaning as ‘have fever and headache’, following the explanation in Shuowen , but treats as coming within a word-family meaning ‘be overturned, collapse’, making ‘troublesome’ an extended sense.

Examples:
  • 頒布 [HANPU] - distribution

  • 頒白 [HANPAKU] - graying hair

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). It consists of 頁 103 ‘head’, combined with 分 218 (‘divide’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘fat, swollen’, thus giving the original meaning ‘large head’. ‘Divide, distribute’ are loan uses. KJ1970:790; OT1968:1103; TA1965:730-32. We suggest taking 頁 ‘head’ as ‘mind’ for one mnemonic, and the literal collection of heads after a battle for another mnemonic. (In the early days of the samurai, heads were indeed seen as trophies, so the more heads one could take the greater one’s reputation. However, the heads were supposed to be cut off a living adversary, but many warriors took the easy way and decapitated corpses. Presently sophisticated techniques were put in place to establish whether the head was cut off a living person or a corpse, and in the latter case it was seen as shameful.)

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 車 33 ‘vehicle’, combined with 笵 (CO, ‘law, pattern’; see Note below) in an abbreviated form as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘cook ritual meat’, giving ‘conduct meat-cooking ritual to purify vehicle’ (Katō), or ii] ‘violate’, giving ‘as purificatory act run over dog and smear vehicle wheels with blood’ (Ogawa); Tōdō also favors the latter overall meaning. This ritual was probably performed when setting out on an important trip or mission. While the original meaning for 範 noted here may seem bizarre from a modern perspective, we should bear in mind that superstition was a very powerful force in ancient times and indeed until the beginnings of modern science started to dispel persistent beliefs held regarding the supernatural. ‘Framework, model’ and related meanings are loan use for 範 . Note: the meaning ‘law, pattern’ for 笵 is noted in Shuowen . This appears to be an extended sense deriving from an original meaning ‘bamboo writing tablet’. DJ2009:v2:379; KJ1970:789; OT1968:986; TA1965:868-71. We suggest taking the lower right element as slumped person.

Consists of 艹 53 ‘plants’, combined with 潘 (CO, ‘cloudy water in which rice has been washed’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hedge, screen, fence’, giving overall meaning ‘hedge, screen, wall’ around a house or similar. ‘Fief’ appears to be an extended sense, and ‘clan’ a further extension, and the meanings ‘hedge, screen, wall’ are now effectively defunct. Note: 潘 comprises 氵 42 ‘water’ with 番 215 (‘number’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘white’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘spread out in circular shape’ (this and i] are both noted in Mizukami), either way giving ‘cloudy water in which rice has been washed’ (associated sense ii] here derives from the circular motion of water when rice or similar is washed in a container).

  • 野蛮 [YABAN] - barbarism

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 蠻 . Consists in one view of 虫 60 ‘insect, snake’ used pejoratively, combined with (CO, ‘tangled thread’ or ‘unravel tangled thread’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘be in disorder/disarray’, giving original meaning ‘ethnic group in ancient southern China who worshipped snakes’ (Ogawa). In another analysis (Katō), is treated as representing an outsider clan name derived from the name of the ancestral deity (fire deity) of the ancient state of Chu ( 楚 ); again, 虫 is considered to have been incorporated pejoratively. Both analyses treat ‘outsiders, barbarians’ as an extended use of 蠻 . Mizukami lists proposed bronze equivalents also. Note: is comprised of 絲 ‘fine thread’ (later written in abbreviated form as 糸 29 ‘thread’), with 言 118 (‘words; speak’). Confusingly, depending on the associated sense, overall meaning is taken as either ‘unravel tangled thread’, or ‘thread becomes tangled’. Both interpretations, listed in Mizukami, reflect ambivalence regarding the meaning of already at the time of compilation of Shuowen . MS19 95:v2:1156-7,1212-13,1012-13; OT1968:887; KJ1970:897-8; ZY2009:v4:1253. We suggest taking the upper part 亦 – which is actually an NJK meaning ‘again’ – as ‘strange red’ ( 赤 48), i.e. ‘reddish’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 石 47 ‘stone’, with 卑 1881 (‘humble’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘small, short’, thus ‘small standing/upright stone’ (Katō), or ii] ‘obstruct’, thus ‘stone to obstruct sunlight’ (Ogawa). These two proposed etymologies are to some extent complementary, as Katō notes the first use of such upright stones was as a device to see the length of shadows from the sun. Later, such stones were used to help lower coffins on ropes down into the ground (Shirakawa notes this was facilitated by holes bored in the stones), and from that practice there also developed the custom (Han onwards) of recording details of the deceased onto the stones.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ).

However, Shirakawa takes 能 here as showing wild animal caught in net, thus meanings such as ‘tire’ and ‘give up’, but this is at odds with his separate analysis of 能 as an independent graph, for which he takes the original meaning as ‘aquatic insect’. OT1968:796; KJ1970:690-91; SS1984:715,675. We suggest taking 能 as a bear.

Note: Scholars vary in their analysis of ; several are very tentative. Gu takes OBI and bronze forms as showing woman combing her long hair ( 攵 [ 攴 ] 112 is taken here as act of combing [not its usual coercion]), giving ‘small, fine’ as extended sense. MS1995:v1:490-91; KJ1970:802-03; GY2008:1053; OT1968:354; SS1984:720. Use ‘mountain’ 山 26, ‘table’ 兀 , and ‘force’ 攵 .

  • 膝行 [SHIKKŌ] - go on one’s knees

Etymology: Seal ( 厀 ) . Seal form has 卩 41 ‘kneeling figure’, with what in one view is treated as 桼 (‘sap, resin’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend’, thus ‘joint for bending leg’, i.e. ‘knee’ (Katō, Gu; see Note below). Shuowen has 厀 ; later, 月 209 ‘flesh, body’ came to be used as determinative in place of 卩 , hence the more familiar 膝. At clerical script stage examples of this graph close in shape to 膝 are found. Note: Katō sees 卩 as a distortion of the seal shape (see right side of seal form above). He also sees 卩 as the original graph for ‘knee’, and 厀 to be – unusually – a form with 桼 added later as phonetic. Ogawa regards not 桼 but the similarly-shaped NJK 黍 (‘millet’) as the phonetic (same associated sense), though in the seal shape of 厀 it seems more like 桼 . KJ1970:178; GY2008:1829; OT1968:827; SK1984:601; MS1995:v2:1510-12. Take 氺 as variant ‘water’ 水 42, 人 cap, and 木 73 ‘wood’.

  • 泌尿科 [HINYŌKA] - urology

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’, combined with 必 597 (‘necessarily’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘flow out continuously’, giving ‘water flows out uninterruptedly’ (Katō), or ii] ‘close, shut’, giving ‘water flows out from gap once closed’ (Ogawa). Shirakawa suggests that 必 serves here as onomatopoeic for the sound of water flowing, but this seems questionable. KJ1970:806; OT1968:568; SS1984:722.

Examples:
  • 愛猫 [AIBYŌ] - pet cat
  • 猫背 [nekoze] - stoop
  • シャム猫 [SHAMUneko] - Siamese cat

Etymology: A late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Originally, this graph was written 貓 . The OBI form of 豸 1363 is considered to depict a carnivorous wild beast about to pounce on its prey (Mizukami, Ogawa). The compound graph 貓 consists of 豸 combined with 苗 1897 (‘seedling’). Ogawa takes 苗 here as phonetic, serving as onomatopoeic for the miaowing sound made by a cat; Late Han period pronunciation of 貓 was mau (Schuessler). The form with 犭 (variant of 犬 19 in compound graphs, meaning dog or other creature/beast perceived as approximating to a dog in some way) in place of 豸 appears to be of late origin; this probably evolved as a popular form, but eventually was adopted as standard in the modern period.

Several clerical script occurrences are close in shape to 怖 . Note: Views on 甫 diverge. Usually taken based on early (OBI/bronze) forms as 屮 ‘plant shoot’ with 田 63 ‘field’ &gt; ‘seedling bed, vegetable field, plant seedlings’ (Ogawa, Tōdō, Gu; Shirakawa broadly agrees). Mizukami notes different view, taking as 父 216 (orig hand holding ax; loan use for ‘father’) over 用 235 ‘use’ (loan meaning), but early forms suggest consensus view is better. Either way, ‘beginning, first’ is seen as an extended sense, indicating beginning stage of horticulture or construction work.

This latter meaning later came to be represented by 訃 1909, while 赴 came to be used in general senses such as ‘proceed’. Mizukami lists a proposed OBI equivalent. OT1968:966; KJ1970:820; QX2000:333.

The latter view is supported by Schuessler, who details a relevant word-family in early Chinese for the phonetic element 竝 here which encompasses ‘spread out, be vast; extensively’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 攴 / 攵 112 ‘beat with stick’, with CO 尃 593 ‘spread out the fingers’ (see Note below) as semantic and phonetic (Ogawa; alternatively, Katō treats as phonetic only, with generalized meaning ‘spread out’ as associated sense), giving ‘beat (something) with stick to spread it out’. Left-hand element of 敷 is a variant of 尃 ; forms close to 敷 can be found at clerical script stage. Note: 尃 comprises 寸 920 ‘hand’, with 甫 (probable original meaning: ‘seedling bed, vegetable field’; see 1906 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘spread the fingers (to measure)’, giving ‘spread the four fingers (to measure)’. OT1968:443; MS1995:582-3; KJ1970:857; SK1984:352. Take left side as variant of 専 925 ‘exclusive’.

<b>膚</b>
Reading: FU, hada
Meaning: skin
Strokes: 15
Level: L2
Number: 1916

Examples:
  • 皮膚炎 [HIFUEN] - dermatitis
  • 皮膚 [HIFU] - skin
  • 鮫膚 [samehada] - shagreen, dry skin

Etymology: Seal ( 臚 ) . Shuowen has 臚 as the entry heading, and notes 膚 as variant. 臚 consists of 月 / 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat, body’, with 盧 (CO, interpretations of meaning vary; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘spread, cover’, giving ‘flesh/that which covers surface of the body’, i.e. ‘skin’. At the clerical script stage, a significant change in shape took place, with left-hand 月 / 肉 commonly omitted and the lower element changed to 胃 447 ‘stomach’ (possibly as just a graphic variant). Note: occurrent OBI and bronze shapes of 盧 vary, and interpretations vary in consequence. Mizukami and Katō are agreed, though, that 盧 and 𧆨 are in essence one and the same graph, 皿 300 (‘bowl’) being an addition in some bronze occurrences. Lower element originally had not 田 63 ‘field’, but an element of roughly similar shape taken to represent a wine container; the upper element in some occurrences is 虍 (originally, pictograph of tiger’s head – an abbreviation of the fuller form 虎 1301 ‘tiger’) serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend, round, concave’. In other occurrences the upper element is seen as an inverted container, and so straining wine is taken to be one part of the meaning. The overall meaning is accordingly taken by Mizukami and Katō to be ‘round wine container made of willow for strained wine’. Gu, alternatively, interprets the graph as meaning ‘stove’. MS1995:v2:1082-3,910-11,1138-9,1140-41; KJ1970:824,898-9; DJ2009:v2:344; OT1968:827; SK1984:601. We suggest taking the lower part of the modern graph as 胃 447 ‘stomach, belly’.

Has 覀 ‘stopper, cover’ (originally a pictograph; not a variant of similarly-shaped 西 169 ‘west’), combined with 復 803 (‘again, repeat’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘wrap, envelop’, giving ‘cover’. ‘Overturn’ is a loan usage.

Note: the OBI form of 弗 is taken by Gu as depicting bent arrows being straightened using cord wrapped round them, while Shirakawa takes it to be cord wrapped round saplings to bind and keep them straight. 弗 was later borrowed as a convenient way of representing a grammatical function word of negative meaning. In older Japanese texts, 弗 is sometimes found used again as a loan – in this case on the basis of shape – for DORU ‘dollar’. OT1968:401; KJ1970:832; GY2008:598; SS1984:202. We suggest taking ム as a nose.

Katō takes 賁 as onomatopoeic, with overall meaning ‘make a noise with the mouth/through the nose’, and regards ‘gush out, exude’ as loan usage. Note: 賁 is comprised of 貝 10 ‘shell’ combined with 卉 as abbreviation of 奔 1991 (‘run, bustle’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘gush out, swell up’, giving ‘beautiful large shell’ (Mizukami). Schuessler gives the meaning ‘ardent’ for 賁 , and this may be an extended sense. OT1968:196; SS1984:757; KJ1970:833; MS1995:v2:1240-41,v1:304-5; AS2007:160. Take upper right as 3 x ‘ten’ 十 35 = 30.

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 倂 . Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with 幷 (traditional form of 并 NJK ‘put/join together’), giving ‘(two persons) lined up/put together’ (see 1904 Note 1). Katō and some others treat it as variant of 幷 / 并 with 亻 added as determinative, which no doubt is the case (see Note below). The meanings of 并 and 併 are the same (‘join together’), but in modern Japanese texts 併 is used rather than 并 . Note: Mizukami lists proposed OBI equivalent for 併 which lacks 亻 , identical to OBI equivalents for 並 977 ‘row, line’). MS1995:v1:74-5,446-7, v2:980-81; OT1968:61; KJ1970:836-7.

  • 幣帛 [HEIHAKU] - Shintō offerings

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 敝 (CO, ‘damaged clothing; be damaged/destroyed’; see Note below)as upper element. The graph consists of 巾 1232 ‘(piece of) cloth’, combined with 敝 as phonetic with associated sense ‘offer up’, giving ‘cloth for offering’. The meaning was later generalized to ‘gift’, and by further extension to ‘currency’. Prayer offerings to the gods of Shintō shrines include in particular cloth, and rope, along with cut and folded paper strips, the latter typically interwoven into an intricate pattern. It has been a tradition to make offerings on particular occasions, often (at least originally) specific to particular localities, such as in some eastern parts of Japan (and probably elsewhere) there are prayers and offerings to the mountain deities on New Year’s Day, in this particular case bundles of straw being hung in trees. Note: 敝 consists of 攴 / 攵 112 ‘strike, cause to do, force’, combined with , a CO ‘rip, tear’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘tear cloth’; by extension, ‘damaged clothing; be damaged/destroyed’. is comprised of 巾 ‘cloth’, with the four short downward diagonal strokes representing rips or tears.

Examples:
  • 弊社 [HEISHA] - our (humble) firm
  • 疲弊 [HIHEI] - exhaustion
  • 弊害 [HEIGAI] - evil, abuse

Etymology: Seal ( 獘 ) ; 弊 is a late, post- Shuowen graph. 獘 consists of 犬 19 ‘dog’, with 敝 (‘damaged clothing; be damaged/destroyed’; see 1936 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘become tired, collapse’, giving ‘dog collapses’ (probably during hunting). ‘Exhaustion’ is an extended sense. Katō takes ‘evil, abuse’ as a loan usage; HEI- as a prefix in Japanese (older literary style) meaning ‘my/our’ (humble connotation) is also probably a loan usage. The popular form 弊 , with the erroneous lower element 廾 (‘hands offering up’, see e.g. 1639) as determinative appears to be a development in block script; in clerical script we find another example of a divergent writing, this one still quite close to 獘 in shape, having 大 56 ‘big’ instead of dog 犬 .

OT1968:872; TA1965:658-61; AS2007:164. Take the elements as ‘grass’ 艹 , ‘force, coerce’ 攴 / 攵 (see 112); and as ‘torn bits of cloth’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ).

Note: 夆 comprises 夂 ‘foot’, a determinative sometimes taken as having the connotation ‘upwards, high’ (Mizukami, Katō), with 丰 (see 1953) ‘luxuriant vegetation; (vegetation) thrusts upwards’ taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘thrust upwards’ (this interpretation noted in Mizukami). KJ1970:862; OT1968:304; TA1965:322; MS1995:v1:284-5. We suggest taking 夂 as ‘sit crosslegged’ and 丰 as telegraph pole (also 1953).

Later used for ‘cannon’. 砲 is noted in Kangxi zidian as the popular form of 礮 . ZY2009:v3:857; KJ1970:762; OT1968:711.

Examples:

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 崩 . It consists of 山 26 ‘mountain’, combined with 朋 (originally [OBI], depiction of multiple strings of shell currency; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘break/split in two, be destroyed’, giving ‘mountain crumbles’; meaning then generalized to ‘crumble, be destroyed’. There is a very minor meaning ‘die’ (used of emperors) which is an extended sense. Note: By extension ‘pair of valuable items’, and by further extension ‘friends; throng together’. MS1995:v1:418-9,636-8; KJ1970:860; OT1968:305. Take 朋 as two moons / months 月 18.

Etymology: Seal ( 蠭 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). The seal form has CO ‘insect (generic)’, with 逢 (‘meet, encounter’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sharp tip’, interpreted in one view as ‘insect with sharp tip’, i.e. ‘bee, wasp’ (Ogawa). Tōdō, though, looks to interpret differently, as referring to a cone-shaped swarm of bees around a queen-bee. In block script, the graph has the same structure but is simplified in shape to 虫 60 ‘insect’, with 夆 as phonetic (same associated sense as explained in 1960 Note: i.e. sharp, point, tip’). Note: 逢 consists of 辶 / 辶 85 ‘walk along a road, go’, with 夆 (‘thrust upwards, revolt; meet’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘come together’, giving original meaning ‘two people approach and meet/encounter each other on a road’ (Mizukami). OT1968:888; TA1965:319-23; MS1995:v2:1296-7; GY2008:1600. As with 1960, we suggest taking 夂 as ‘sit crosslegged’ and 丰 as telegraph pole.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has the older left-hand equivalent of 飠 , viz. , combined with a right-hand element 包 (traditional form of 包 ‘envelop, wrap’ 611) (see Note below). Consists of 163 ‘food, eat’, with 包 / 包 as semantic and phonetic in its original meaning ‘swell up’, giving ‘stomach grows through eating’, and by extension ‘become satiated, tire’. Note: the element 巳 in 包 – later modified to 己 , giving 包 – originally represented an infant in the womb, not a snake; OBI occurrences of the two are very similar (if not identical in some cases, with meaning distinguished only by context) and hence easily confused. OT1968:1116; MS1995:v2:1456-8; GY2008:688.

Has 衣 444 ‘garment’, with a middle element that in seal stage corresponded to 孚 (‘deliver newborn infant’, etc. – see 1911 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘swell up’, thus ‘garment with big exaggerated sleeves’ (Ogawa); Tōdō broadly agrees. 褒 seems to be block script onwards; Kangxi zidian has 襃 . Modern form (1923 Jōyō kanji List onwards) has 保 808 (‘preserve’) sandwiched between ‘split garment’. DJ2009:v2;677; OT1968:908; TA1965:234; SK1984:647.

Examples:
  • 坊主 [BŌZU*] - priest
  • 坊や [BŌya] - boy
  • 坊間 [BŌKAN] - ‘around town’

Etymology: Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 方 223 ‘side, direction, square’. Taken in one view as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘square’, giving ‘square-shaped division/plot of land’ (Ogawa). A different analysis takes 方 as phonetic with associated sense ‘plot of land’ and 土 , giving ‘plot of land’ (Shirakawa); ‘town’ is an extended large-scale sense. Shirakawa notes that 坊 was used to denote plots of land – typically square – in a city divided up in terms of a traditional grid system. In turn, 坊 came to be applied in a Buddhist context for the divisions of space in a temple (including rooms), and the chief priest was known as 坊 主 BŌZU , a term which later came to be used as a general word meaning ‘(Buddhist) priest’; ‘boy’ seems to be a generalized sense deriving from ‘young boy priest’. ‘Town’ is now quite rare as a meaning.

Examples:

  • 妨げ無し [samatagenashi] - without a hitch

Etymology: Seal . Has 女 37 ‘woman’, with 方 223 (‘side, direction’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘obstruct’ (Ogawa; Tōdō says ‘hold hands out to both sides and obstruct’), giving ‘woman who obstructs’ or ‘one who extends hands to both sides and prevents others from approaching a woman’ (both interpretations are listed in Mizukami). In another analysis, 方 is treated as phonetic with associated sense ‘vilify, calumnify’, giving ‘woman who vilifies others’ (Katō). In either case, sense became generalized and not gender-specific, and with ‘obstruct’ as the principal meaning. Mizukami lists a proposed OBI equivalent. OT1968:253; TA1965:443; MS1995:v1:318-9; KJ1970:763.

Examples:
  • 傍聴 [BŌCHŌ] - attendance
  • 傍観 [BŌKAN] - looking on
  • 傍注 [BŌCHŪ] - margin notes

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views differ. One view has 亻 41 ‘person’ with 旁 (NJK, originally meaning ‘bring two boats alongside each other’, thus ‘person in charge of boats’, i.e. ‘boatman’). ‘Side’ is then seen as extended sense derived from 旁 (Katō). Alternatively, 旁 is taken as meaning ‘everywhere, side’, with 亻 added to indicate meaning of ‘side’ (Ogawa). Schuessler confirms meanings ‘side’ and ‘everywhere’ for 旁 , and ‘side’ may well be the extended sense as Katō suggests, but there is the question of why 亻 ‘person’ would be added to denote the meaning ‘side’. The first analysis seems more persuasive. KJ1970:764; OT1968:77; AS2007:409. Take 旁 as ‘side’ 方 223 and as ‘stand’ 立 77 strangely.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Original graph is taken to be 皃 , showing a person 儿 41 wearing a face mask ( 白 ) (Ogawa, Tōdō). In one view, taken as mask for a deceased person, the mask representing emphasis on outer form or appearance, hence the sense ‘form, appearance’ (Shirakawa). 豸 (1363, wide semantic range including ‘predatory wild beast’ and ‘crawling insect’) is an element added later (Qiu notes that some see this as abbreviation of 豹 [NJK, ‘leopard, panther’]), apparently with a phonetic function. OT1968:951; TA1965:280; SS1984:795-6; QX2000:299; MS1995:v2:1226-9. Take 白 as ‘white’ 69.

Later the graph acquired a negative connotation. MS1995:v2:1208-9; KJ1970:757; OT1968:939; AS2007:391.

It seems that another word having the same pronunciation in early Chinese meaning ‘as yet untouched/unworked natural tree wood’, once written 樸 (NJK), was sometimes written by substituting 朴 instead. Used in this way, 朴 acquired an extended sense from 樸 , i.e. ‘naïve, unsophisticated, artless’. TA1965:317-9; DJ2009:v2:463,467; GY2008:229-30.

Examples:

  • 撲殺 [BOKUSATSU] - beat to death

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 手 / 扌 34 ‘hand’, combined with (CO; implement for striking or gouging) as phonetic, here serving as onomatopoeic for the sound of impact against the material concerned. The overall original meaning is ‘hit using the hand’, which was then generalized to ‘hit, strike, beat’. Note: regarding the irregular reading for sumo in the example words, the two graphs mean ‘mutual striking’. KJ1970:773; MS1995:v1:560-61; OT1968:430. As with 1985, we suggest taking as a variant of (= odd) 業 278 ‘profession’.

Examples:
  • 沈没 [CHINBOTSU] - sinking
  • 日没 [NICHIBOTSU] - sunset
  • 没後 [BOTSUGO] - after death

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form: 沒 . Interpretations diverge. The seal form points to the original way of writing this graph as corresponding to 𠬸 . The top element in 𠬸 is an old form of 回 92 ‘go round’, with 又 2003 ‘hand’ beneath. This is interpreted in one view as ‘put hand into water and take something out’ (Gu, Ogawa [Ogawa takes to be water swirling round]); alternatively, taken as ‘try to pull out person drowning’ (Shirakawa). is a later (block script) variant of 𠬸 , and quite close in shape to 殳 as in the modern form 没 (see Note below). At the seal stage, 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’ was then added as a determinative, resulting in 沒 . Several commentators prefer to analyse 沒 differently, taking it as consisting of 氵 ‘water’ combined with as phonetic with associated sense ‘sink, disappear’, giving ‘sink down into whirlpool’ (Katō, Mizukami). The connotation ‘go round, whirlpool’ is supported by the seal form. If the interpretation ‘sink down into whirlpool’ is followed, ‘sink, die, not exist’ may be regarded as extended senses. Note: The right-hand element in the modern form is 殳 , normally a determinative meaning ‘strike (with weapon)’ (170), but in 没 this is instead a later, potentially confusing regularization in shape of with meaning as explained above. GY2008:501; OT1968:563; KJ1970:866; SK1984:441; MS1995:v2:738-9; SS1984:906. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 殳 as ‘strike’.

Another view takes / 麻 ‘flax’ as both semantic and phonetic in function here, giving ‘open up flax-like plant material and put between the hands’ (to extract fibers) (Katō). The meaning of 摩 was later generalized to ‘rub, graze, scrape’. See 磨 1997 also. Note: 靡 consists of 麻 (originally written [see 麻 1995]) with 非 794 (‘not’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘open up’, to give ‘split open flax-like plant material and take out small fibers’; by extension, ‘small; scatter’, and also loan use for grammatical function word.

While in the modern world we think of a pillow as something soft, in ancient China (and prewar Japan) hard materials such as wood and bamboo (and later porcelain) appear to have been the norm. TA1965:789-93; SS1984:609-10; MS1995:v1:112-13. As with 1729, we suggest taking 冘 as (heavy) man with crooked leg and broken arms.

Etymology: Seal ( 鬽 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). 鬽 is entry heading in Shuowen , but text lists 魅 as alternative form. For analysis of 鬽 , see Note below. 魅 has 鬼 1179 ‘supernatural being, demon’, with 未 617 (‘immature’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘not visible’, thus ‘spectral being, ghost’; by extension, ‘enchant, bewitch’. Note: 鬽 has 鬼 1179 ‘demon’, here likely in its original sense of ‘spirit of dead person, supernatural being’, with 彡 115 ‘decorative feathers/colors, embellishment’, here taken as ‘long hair’, to give ‘longhaired supernatural being’. The ancient Chinese historical work Zuo Zhuan chooses to define more specifically as a four-legged beast with human face. KJ1970:868; DJ2009:v2:738-9; OT1968:1140.

Another treatment takes the associated sense as ‘delicious smell’, giving ‘insects’ delicious-smelling (food)’, i.e. ‘honey’ (Ogawa). The graph was later abbreviated to 蜜 by using 虫 ‘insect’ for , and changing the phonetic to 宓 (CO, ‘quiet house’) (same associated sense as above). DJ2009:v3:1101; KJ1970:807; GY2008:1762; OT1968:889; MS1995:v2:1144-5. Suggest elements as 宀 30 ‘roof/building/hive’, 必 597 ‘necessarily’, and 虫 60 ‘insect’.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 艹 53 ‘plants’, with 戊 (NJK, ‘[type of ] halberd/battle-ax’ 1591; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘cover’, giving ‘plants cover’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), or ii] ‘luxuriant, abundant’, giving ‘luxuriant vegetation’ (Gu, Katō). Note: Mizukami also lists ‘(type of) plane’ as possible meaning for 戊 , which was originally a pictograph, though the OBI and bronze forms do suggest a weapon rather than a tool.

Alternatively, 亡 is regarded as phonetic in function with associated sense ‘hidden’, giving ‘hidden and not visible’, with ‘blind’ as an extended sense (Tōdō). OT1968:696; TA1965:445-7.

Examples:
  • 消耗 [SHŌMŌ] - consumption
  • 損耗 [SONMŌ] - wastage, loss
  • 磨耗 [MAMŌ] - wear and tear

Etymology: Seal ( 秏 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). The seal form has 禾 87 ‘grain’ (generic), with 毛 230 (‘hair, fur’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘empty’, giving original meaning ‘grain missing, no grain’, and by extension ‘empty; run out, use up’ (Katō). Shuowen defines 秏 as ‘type of rice’, which is how the graph and underlying word may have been used around the time of compilation of Shuowen , but 禾 is originally a pictograph of a grain plant with the head leaning down, and is generally understood as ‘grain’ as a general term encompassing millet, wheat, and rice, not just rice alone; as above, Katō takes in the general sense. Another commentator treats 毛 here as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘small’, and considers it to denote ‘small grains of rice’ (sic; Ogawa). As for the change in shape to 耗 , with the determinative changed from 禾 ‘grain’ to 耒 ’plow’ (CO, 699), this appears to have been a change made at some point in block script. Kangxi zidian has entries for both 秏 and 耗 ; in the entry for the former, it is noted that ‘texts nowadays all use 耗 ’. KJ1970:172-3; OT1968:808; MS1995:v2:960-61,1054-5; SK1984:588; DJ2009:v2:565; ZY2009:v3:869,1000;. We suggest taking 耒 as multi-branched tree 木 73.

Examples:

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 犭/犬 19 ‘dog’, with 孟 (‘first child; beginning’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘vigorous, strong, violent’, giving ‘fierce/violent dog’. Meanings such as ‘brave’ are extended senses. Note: analyses of 孟 (NJK, ‘beginning’) differ. In one view, 孟 comprises 子 27 ‘child’, with 皿 300 ‘bowl, cover’ taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘first’, giving ‘first child’ (Mizukami). Alternatively, 皿 is taken as semantic meaning ‘cover’, giving ‘child emerges (from beneath cover)/grows’ (Tōdō). Another view takes 皿 semantically as a bowl for bathing, giving ‘newborn baby’s first bath’, and hence ‘first’. Schuessler says ‘eldest (of siblings); first’. OT1968:645; GY2008:1291; KJ1970:769; MS1995:v1:352-3; TA1965:449-54; AS2007:381.

Examples:
  • 紋章 [MONSHŌ] - heraldic crest

  • 波紋 [HAMON] - ripple

Etymology: A late, post- Shuowen graph. Originally written just as 文 72 (original meaning ‘pattern’; now ‘writing, text’). 文 was used increasingly to mean ‘writing’, and when the meaning ‘pattern’ was intended this was indicated by adding 糸 29 ‘thread’ as determinative to give 紋 . In Japanese, 紋 is now typically ‘crest’. OT1968:771; SS1984:825; KJ1970:220.

Level: L1
Number: 2028

Examples:
  • 冶金 [YAKIN] - metallurgy
  • 陶冶 [TŌYA] - training
  • 鍛冶屋 [kajiya*] - blacksmith

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Seal form consists of 冫 401 ‘ice’, with 台 (‘I, me’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one approach either as i] ‘grow slack, relax’, or ii] ‘modify’. Either way, the resultant meaning is ‘smelt metal’ (in the case of i], by extension, and in ii] by indirect extension on the basis ‘modify metal in the same way as melting ice’). Another interpretation, though, takes the right-hand element in one of the bronze occurrences as a shape representing not ‘ice’ but ‘fire’. This commentator (Gu) still recognises 冫 ‘ice’ as the determinative in the seal form, explaining this as being by analogy (melting of ice and smelting metal both resulting in liquid states). Note: On the basis of sound values and older forms (bronze and seal) the phonetic element 台 in 冶 is to be taken not as 台 183 ‘stand, platform’ (traditional form: 臺 ), but a different graph of the same shape meaning ‘(say) I, me’. The latter consists of 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, with 厶 (interpretations vary, but include ‘make one’s own’, or ‘plow’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘I, me’. MS1995:v1:116-8,204-5,188-90; OT1968:103; GY2008:487. For mnemonic purposes only, we suggest taking here 台 as ‘platform’, or alternatively ム as nose and 口 as mouth 22.

Examples:
  • 弥生 [Yayoi*] - period c400BC-cAD250
  • 弥次馬 [yaJIuma] - mob, onlookers
  • 沙弥 [SHAMI] - Buddhist acolyte

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 彌 . The seal form consists of 弓 107 ‘bow’, with a variant of 璽 1419 “Imperial seal’ (q.v.) minus the dot low down, as phonetic with associated sense ‘slacken, loosen’; this gives ‘unstring a bow’; meaning then extended to ‘slacken, loosen’. Senses such as ‘increasingly’ are the result of a loan use. The right-hand element of 弥 perhaps reflects adaptation to block script of a cursified version of this graph, with the number of strokes reduced through writing cursively. KJ1970:484; KZ2001:757-8/3671; OT1968:340. Difficult mnemonically, but we suggest taking the right-hand part as variant ‘person’  41, and ‘small’ 小 38.

Examples:

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 足 54 ‘leg/foot’, and 翟 236, CO meaning ‘pheasant’ but also in word-family meaning ‘rise up, leap up’. Latter meaning was clarified by adding 足 , thus 躍 . Typically, 翟 here is taken as phonetic with the above associated sense, but Gu takes as both semantic and phonetic in function. TA1965:247-9; OT1968:977; MS1995:v2:1048-9; GY2008:1245; AS2007: 497; KJ1970:874. Take 翟 literally as ‘bird’ 隹 324 and ‘wings’ 羽 82.

Tōdō takes ‘dark’ as an extended sense, while a noted pre-modern commentator on Shuowen (Duan Yucai, 1735-1815) regards as a loan use. OT1968:1062; TA1965:815-24; DJ2009:v3:967.

Examples:
  • 比喩 [HIYU] - metaphor, simile
  • 比喩的 [HIYUTEKI] - figurative
  • 換喩 [KAN’YU] - metonymy

Etymology: Seal a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, with 兪 (CO, ‘hollow out log as boat’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘transfer, change’, giving original meaning ‘instruct’. ‘Speak figuratively, compare’ may perhaps be an extended sense. Note: the bronze form of 兪 is interpreted in one view as 舟 1450 ‘boat’, with a second element which is interpreted as ‘snake/cicada with cast-off skin’, giving ‘hollow out inner part of log and leave outer part as boat’ (Katō). Mizukami notes an alternative view which takes the second element as ‘blade for scraping/gouging out’, but giving the same overall meaning. Shirakawa, alternatively again, takes 舟 as ‘bowl’ (presumably a meaning extended from ‘hollow out log as boat’ [based on a classical Chinese source, but Tōdō does not agree]) and the main part of the second element as a large surgical needle for removing blood and pus, with the accompanying single stroke as ‘showing blood and pus being transferred into the bowl’. The graph ( 兪 ) exhibits some variation in shape in bronze. OT1968:191; KJ1970:500-01; MS1995:v1:100-01; SS1984:829; AS2007:623; TA1965:173-4. Difficult mnemonically, but we suggest taking 月 209 as ‘meat, body’, with arrows/pointers 巜 pointing to it, 亼 as a cover, and using 口 not as ‘speak’ but rather as ‘hole’.

Has 言 118 ‘words, speak’, with 兪 (CO; see 2033 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘clarify’, giving ‘make clear with words’ (Katō), or ii] ‘remove’, giving ‘remove that which is not understood’, giving ‘instruct, give guidance’ (Ogawa). KJ1970:881; OT1968:939. As with 2034, we suggest taking 月 as ‘meat’ 209, 刂 as ‘cut’ 198, and 亼 as a cover.

Has 疒 404 ‘sick(bed)’, with 兪 (see 2033 Note) (later 愈 ) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge, quietly leave’, giving ‘emerge from illness’, i.e. ‘heal’. In the graph 癒 , 愈 as phonetic may be taken as a variant of 兪 . Note: Shirakawa sees 愈 and 愉 (traditional form of 愉 2034 has 兪 ) as variants of same graph, difference in form of ‘heart/feelings’ determinative ( 心 / 忄 , 164) not significant. Mizukami, though, sees 愈 and 愉 as two different graphs, but does not elaborate. OT1968:682; SS1984:830-31; GY2008:1624; MS1995:v1:518-9. Take 月 as ‘meat’ 209, 刂 as ‘cut’ 198, and 亼 as a cover.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 心 164 ‘feelings, heart, mind’, with 攸 (CO, ‘remove dirt/defilement’; see Note below’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘shake, jolt’, giving ‘one’s heart shakes, lament’ (Ogawa). This associated sense is noted by Mizukami along with another, viz. ‘continue in tenuous way’, giving ‘feelings continue in delicate and unhurried manner’. Note: 攸 is comprised of 攴 ( 攵 ) 112 ‘hit, strike’, with left-hand element interpreted as either ‘remove dirt’, giving overall meaning ‘remove dirt’, or ‘water drips down’ (some bronze occurrences of 攸 have three short vertical strokes instead of one [ 丨 ] to the right of 亻 41 (‘person’), lending support to interpretation as ‘water’), giving ‘cleanse body by letting water drip onto it’. Both interpretations are noted in Mizukami. OT1968:373; MS1995:v1:512-3,568-9; KJ1970:25-6. We suggest taking the upper part as 亻 41 ‘person’, 丨 as long stick, and strike 攵 .

Examples:
  • 憂愁 [YŪSHŪ] - grief, gloom
  • 憂え顔 [ureegao] - sad look
  • 物憂い [monoui] - weary, gloomy

Etymology: Seal ( 𢝊 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). 𢝊 (the original form of 憂 in Shuowen ) has 心 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, with 頁 103 (‘head’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘shrink, flinch’, thus giving ‘one’s heart shrinks/flinches’, or ii] ‘thin, flimsy’, giving ‘one’s heart grows weak with worries’, or iii] ‘faint, dim, easily sinks’, giving ‘one’s heart easily sinks through fear’ (the above interpretations all listed in Mizukami). In one view, the fuller form 憂 is taken as 夂 ‘foot, footprint’, combined with 𢝊 as phonetic with associated sense ‘do as one pleases’, thus giving original meaning ‘stroll around as one pleases’ (Mizukami); ‘lament, grieve’ is loan usage in this view. Another analysis takes as 頁 ‘head’ combined with 心 ‘heart, mind, feelings’ and 夂 ‘drag the foot’ (sic, but this is the meaning of similarly-shaped 夊 ), giving ‘legs unsteady through worry’ (also noted in Mizukami). For the troublesome elements 夂 and 夊 , see Appendix. DJ2009:v3:866; MS1995:v1:518-19,524-5; KJ1970:36. We suggest taking the lower part 夂 as crossed legs, upper part as variant or ‘strange’ head , and ‘heart’ 心 in the middle.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of NJK 鬲 1431 ‘three-legged cauldron (with hollow legs)’ with 虫 60 (‘insect’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise up’, giving ‘steam rises/escapes’. It is not clear whether ‘melt, dissolve’ is an extended sense or loan use of 融 . Note: 虫 here may also have an onomatopoeic connotation for the sound of steam escaping (Mizukami, Katō), but the early Chinese values for 虫 are not really supportive of this. DJ2009:v1:240; MS1995:v2:1148-9; KJ1970:881; AS2007:189,443; TA1965:185-9. We suggest taking 鬲 as ‘one’ 一 1 round pot 口 , and stand .

The abbreviated shape 誉 appears to be based on cursivized occurrences (calligraphic models of Tang Dynasty onwards) of 譽 . TA1965:428-9; OT1968:929; KJ1970:136; FC1974:v2:2087-8.

Etymology: Seal ( 𡝩 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Shuowen has 女 37 ‘woman’, with 芺 (CO, a bitter-tasting type of plant) as phonetic; the graph is defined in that work as ‘skilful, or “woman smiling/laughing” ’. Later form 妖 has 女 combined with 夭 ‘young, beautiful’ (see Note below) taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘seductive, enticing (female)’ (Ogawa). Later, also used in negative senses such as ‘ominous, unlucky’, possibly as a result of interchange or contamination between 妖 and 夭 (see Note below). Note: 夭 is interpreted in one analysis as representing a figure with tilted head acting flirtatiously (Mizukami; Katō is in broad agreement). Ogawa also takes it to show a tilted head, but as an infant with supple body, giving ‘young’. 夭 was used in early Chinese texts not just for the words with the positive meanings just noted, but also for words which were near-homophone(s) with negative meanings. 女 was added later to minimize ambiguity in writing between the two. The semantic progression for the group of words with negative associations is considered to be as follows: ‘bend’ &gt; ‘break, cut off’ &gt; ’kill prematurely’(later, 殀 ) (Schuessler). DJ2009:v3:1022; ZY2009:v3:1066; OT1968: 254,244; AS2007:559-60; MS1995:v1:296-8; KJ1970:84-5. Take 夭 as ‘big man’ 大 56 with big head .

Etymology: Bronze ; seal . Originally (OBI, bronze) consists of 丮 (CO; depiction of a kneeling figure doing something with the hands: see also 1424), combined with 昜 161 (originally ‘sun rises’, modern meanings ‘change, easy’, see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise/lift up’, giving ‘lift up with the hands’. At the seal stage, 丮 was changed to 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’ Note: the original top element in bronze stage equivalents of 昜 is taken in one view to be 日 66 ‘sun’; Katō considers the lower elements to be 丂 130 (‘floating aquatic plant’, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise’, together with 彡 115 ‘feathers, colored feathers’, the latter representing colored (reflected) rays of the sun. According to Katō, the overall meaning then becomes ‘colors/brilliance of the risen morning sun’; ‘rise up’ is an extended sense. Another analysis takes the top part of 昜 as ‘jade disc/precious stone on a stand’, with rays of reflected light (Shirakawa), leading to ‘raise up (as an offering)’. The meaning ‘fry’ is probably loan usage, though it may possibly relate to raising some food item from a vat, which would suggest an extended meaning. MS1995:v1:558-9,618-9; KJ1970:877-8; SS1984:846,849.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 搖 . Consists of 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’, with (CO, ‘bake pottery/earthenware’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘move without stopping’ (Katō), or ii] ‘shake’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘supple, pliant’ (Ogawa), giving overall meaning ‘shake, sway’. Note: consists of 缶 , originally meaning ‘earthenware vessel’ 缶 1141 (here in 2052 taken as representative of pottery/earthenware), with 月 ( 肉 ) 209 ‘meat, flesh’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘bake [tiles etc.]’ (Katō; Gu is in broad agreement). The modern form has a simplification to the upper right element. KJ1970:83-4; TA1965:195-6; OT1968:424; GY2008:1089-90. We suggest taking 爫 1739 ‘reaching hand, claw’, and 缶 1141 as ‘can’.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 氵 water’ 42, with 容 822 (‘contain; appearance’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘vigorous/extensive’, giving ‘pour water into container up to the brim’ (Katō), or ii] ‘well up’, giving ‘current/force of water is strong’ (Ogawa). The senses ‘melt’ and ‘dissolve’ appear to represent loan usage resulting from earlier interchangeability between 溶 with 熔 ‘melt’ and 鎔 ‘smelt/melt’ (both NJK) (Ogawa, Katō). OT1968:602; KJ1970:888. We suggest taking 容 as 宀 30 ‘roof, house’ and 谷 135 ‘valley’.

  • 盆踊り [BON odori] - Bon Dance

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, combined with 甬 (CO, ‘suspension ring at top of bell’; see 2040 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit, strike’, giving original meaning ‘stamp feet on the ground’. Shirakawa suggests this may have been part of a funerary ritual, but does not elaborate. ‘Dance’ may be regarded as an extended sense if one follows this view. In similar vein, Katō also regards the meaning of the graph as ‘feet leaving the ground’, hence ‘dance’. OT1968:973; SS1984:852; KJ1985:589-90. We suggest taking the elements as 足 ‘leg’, 用 as ‘use’ 235, and マ as ‘bent knee’ (or ‘bent elbow’ for those who ‘do the turkey’).

<b>窯</b>

Examples:
  • 窯業 [YŌGYŌ] - ceramics
  • 窯業家 [YŌGYŌKA] - ceramist
  • 乾燥窯 [KANSŌgama] - drying kiln

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 穴 860 ‘hole, cave’, combined with 羔 (NJK, ‘newborn lamb’), taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘bake’, giving ‘cavity for baking earthenware’, i.e. ‘kiln, oven’ (Ogawa). The graph 羔 is made up of 羊 426 (‘sheep’, slightly abbreviated to ), combined with 灬 ( 火 ) 8, ‘fire’ making it a distinct possibility that ‘roast a lamb’ may have been the original meaning, then generalized to ‘roast, bake’, but most commentators do not favor this analysis, probably in part at least because Shuowen defines 羔 as ‘newborn lamb’. Amniotic fluid takes its name from the Greek term amnos (lamb), and features in some graphs relating to human birth (see 432), so it is tempting to interpret the four dots in the modern form as droplets of amniotic fluid. However, the seal form above shows clearly that it is definitely the fire determinative. Shirakawa supports ‘newborn lamb’ on the basis of certain seal forms, the shape of which might be interpreted as ‘lamb/sheep standing’. Note, though, that Ma and Gu give much older OBI forms that clearly have 火 as the bottom element. A later popular variant of 窯 is 窰 , with ‘bake pottery/earthenware’ (CO; see 2052 Note) as the lower element. OT1968:743; SS1984:852,302-3; MR2007:294; GY2008:1121. We suggest taking as ‘little sheep’ (i.e. lamb), along with ‘hole’ 穴 860 as ‘pit’, and ‘fire’ 灬 8.

Etymology: Seal ( 𢹬 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). The seal form has 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’, with 雝 (CO, ‘bird protects its eggs’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘surround, enclose’, giving ‘enclose with the hands/arms, embrace’; by extension, ‘protect’. Kangxi zidian lists both 𢹬 and 擁 , but the 𢹬 entry refers the reader to 擁 as the main entry. 雝 as phonetic in was later abbreviated to 雍 . Note: 雝 is comprised of 隹 324 ‘bird’, with 邕 (CO; ‘external moat [around city, etc.]’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘enclose, block off’. Mizukami also notes an alternative interpretation, namely ‘enclose and protect birds’. Either way, the overall meaning is still ‘embrace, surround’. KJ1970:884; OT1968:431.1078; MS1995:v2:1412-3,1318-9; ZY2009:v2:442,436; AS2007:577. We suggest taking the graph’s elements as ‘hand’ 扌 , ‘bird’ 隹 , top 亠 , and 乡 as variant of ‘short thread’, 幺 29.

Etymology: Seal ( 𩙺 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 羽 as top element. Shuowen has 飛 595 (‘fly’), with 異 826 (‘differ’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pair of wings, pair’, thus ‘bird flies with pair (of wings)’. 翼 , with 羽 ( 羽 82 ‘wings’) as top element, is also noted. Clerical script occurrences also have the more familiar and less intricate 羽 / 羽 . Kangxi zidian lists both forms with 飛 and 羽 as top element, as separate entries (form with latter is main).

Shuowen has CO as entry heading, but goes on to note 裸 as an alternative form. Note: scholars differ regarding historical fluctuation in the form of the phonetic element in this graph and its interpretation. We have taken the broader view.

Note 2: An alternative view of 賴 (noted by Mizukami) takes seal form right side not as 刀 ‘knife’ but as 勹 41 ‘person’ (both similar in shape at the seal stage) over 貝 , and left side as 朿 (CO, ‘thorn’ as abbrev of 刺 1403 ‘stab’) with associated sense as ‘indiscriminate’, thus ‘put responsibility onto others when borrowing and lending money’. ‘Request, rely’ are extended meanings.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation’, combined with 監 1159 (‘supervise, watch’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Shuowen defines 藍 as a ‘plant to dye things blue’. It refers to the plant itself, and by extension its use as a dye for the color indigo (dark violet-blue). The first recorded use of indigo in Japan was in a Nara temple around 620, and for a century or so it was used only by the privileged classes. However, from around the 9th century it became widely available through the advent of vat dyeing. It is especially favored for its resistance to fading and water. In modern times indigo dye has been produced synthetically. OT1968:876; SS1984:866; GY2008:1547.

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 闌 (NJK, ‘partition’), taken in one view semantically to give ‘wood for partition’, and by extension ‘railing’; by further extension, ‘boundary’ (Ogawa). Another view takes 闌 slightly differently as phonetic with associated sense ‘enclose on four sides’, with overall meaning ‘pen (for animals)’ (supported by Shirakawa as a minor meaning), and more broadly as ‘frame which surrounds’ (Katō). Regarding ‘margin, column’ in a written text, Shirakawa notes the term 烏糸欄 ushiran referred to main text on a page enclosed in the traditional way with four lines in a box shape, and the space outside the box, i.e. the margin space, was termed 欄外 rangai .

Examples:
  • 履歴 [RIREKI] - curriculum vitae
  • 履行 [RIKŌ] - performance
  • 履物 [hakimono] - footwear

Etymology: Seal ( 𢔃 ) . Analyses diverge. Leaving aside initially the top element 尸 (256 ‘corpse’, ‘person lying down’: see below), there is general agreement regarding the element 舟 1450 (‘boat’), namely that here it represents boat-shaped footwear. This combines with 彳 131 ‘road; go’, and an element for ‘foot’ here typically identified by scholars as 夊 , which is often interpreted as ‘drag the foot’ (see Appendix). These three elements contribute to an overall meaning ‘walk (slowly) dragging the feet wearing shoes/clogs’ (‘wooden shoes’, i.e. ‘clogs’ is favored by Katō). The top element 尸 (‘corpse’, also meanings including ‘substitute person for deceased’ [in a ritual context]) is treated in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘drag’ (Katō, Mizukami). Alternatively, 尸 here is taken not as phonetic but semantic as ‘substitute person for the deceased ’, and the whole graph is considered in this view originally to have referred to the wearing of shoes (made not of wood but of fabric) when conducting a ritual (Shirakawa). The two similarly-shaped ‘foot’ elements 夂 and 夊 appear to have given rise to a degree of confusion and fluctuation over the centuries, and 履 is a case in point: clerical script occurrences predominantly have the ‘foot’ element changed from 夊 to 夂 (assuming one accepts that the element here was originally 夊 ), and in terms of overall shape the graph was moving towards its modern form at that stage. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. ‘Act’ is probably an extended sense. MS1995:v1:412-4; DJ2009:v2:692; KJ1970:296-7; SS1984:872; SK1984:244. We suggest taking elements of the modern form as 復 (803 ‘again, repeat’) and corpse 尸 .

<b>璃</b>
Reading: RI
Meaning: lapis lazuli
Strokes: 15
Level: L1
Number: 2077

Examples:
  • 瑠璃 [RURI] - lapis lazuli
  • 浄瑠璃 [JŌRURI] - jōruri ballad drama
  • は璃 [HARI] - glass, crystal

Etymology: A late, post- Shuowen graph. Has 玉 15 ‘jewel’ (in abbreviated shape ), with 离 (CO; ‘mountain deity [in beast form]’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Overall meaning according to 6th century Yupian dictionary is ‘lapis lazuli’, a deep blue semi-precious stone. Originally, 璃 seems to have referred to ore of lapis lazuli, then by extension to it when refined, then to natural crystal, then to early form of glass. GY2008:1678; OT1968:727. Awkward. We suggest 亠 as lid, 凶 as box with contents, and ‘strange insect’ ( 虫 60).

Examples:
  • 分離 [BUNRI] - separation
  • 離陸 [RIRIKU] - take-off
  • 乳離れ [chibanare] - weaning

Etymology: Seal . Analyses diverge. In one analysis the graph is taken as 隹 324 ‘bird’, with 离 (CO, ‘mountain deity [in beast form]’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear), originally denoting a type of bird (‘black-naped oriole’ [ Oriolus chinensis ]); and in this view meanings such as ‘become separated’ are seen as loan usage (Ogawa). Another analysis takes 离 as an abbreviation for 黐 ‘birdlime’, giving overall meaning for 離 as ‘bird caught on birdlime’; and by extension, ‘remove from birdlime’, a meaning which was then generalized to ‘remove’ (with obvious connotations of separation and leaving) (Shirakawa). The above explanation relates to the seal form. Mizukami proposes OBI equivalents also, though his analysis relates to the seal form, and he regards ‘become separated’ as a loan use. OT1968:1081; SS1984:873; MS1995:v2:1414-15; AS2007:348. As with 2077, we suggest taking the elements of this awkward character as 亠 as a lid, 凶 as a box with contents, and ‘strange insect’ ( 虫 60).

Etymology: OBI ; seal ; traditional 龍 . Originally visualized depiction of dragon with long snaking body. Shape varies in OBI and bronze forms but was regularized at seal stage. The abbreviated form 竜 may well be based on Tang dynasty cursive models. In Chinese tradition a dragon is seen as a symbol of goodness and strength, not threatening and fire-belching as in Western cultures. MS1995:v2:1526-7; QX2000:177,238; GY2008:146.

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 米 220 ‘rice’ (originally [OBI] grains of cereal, not necessarily rice; q.v.), with 立 77 (’stand’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘scattered’, giving ‘individual (rice) grains’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘be lined up together’, giving ‘cereal grains of same shape collected together’, and by extension ‘(individual) grain’ (Tōdō, Mizukami). ‘Particle’ is an extended sense.

Examples:
  • 隆盛 [RYŪSEI] - prosperity
  • 隆起 [RYŪKI] - upthrust, bulge
  • 興隆 [KŌRYŪ] - prosperity, rise

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 隆 . Interpretations differ. In one view, the graph consists of 阝(阜) 262 ‘hill, mound’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘swell up’, giving ‘hill swells/rises up’ (Ogawa). Another analysis takes as 生 44 ‘life, birth, grow’, with 降 873 (‘descend’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘luxuriant, big’, giving ‘grow luxuriantly’ (Gu). Senses such as ‘high; prosper’ are extended meanings. Quite a different interpretation is adopted by Shirakawa, who alone treats 阝 as having religious significance meaning ‘ladder for deities (to descend and ascend)’, combined with 夂 meaning ‘descend’ (see Appendix) and 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, signifying the welcoming of deities down to Earth. Qiu indicates that old (e.g. clerical script) forms of 隆 with 土 ‘earth’ in place of 生 do exist, which he takes as consisting of 土 combined with 降 as phonetic in function. Note that the modern form has dropped the short horizontal line on the right-side of the traditional form. OT1968:1071; GY2008:1345; SS1984:878; QX2000:254. We suggest taking 夂 as crossed legs.

GY2008:654,260-61; OT1968:68; SS1984:880. We suggest taking the right side as two mouths (speaking) 口 22 with a link between their comments. Or, mouth-to-mouth contact.

Examples:
  • 虜囚 [RYOSHŪ] - captive
  • 捕虜 [HORYO] - prisoner of war
  • 宣誓俘虜 [SENSEIFURYO] - parolee

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 力 78 ‘strength’, combined with 毌 1148 ‘pierce, penetrate’ (see Note below), with – in one view – 虍 1301 (‘tiger’, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense ‘prison’, giving ‘put in prison; prisoner’ (Ogawa). Gu makes a broadly similar analysis, but takes 虍 as having a semantic as well as phonetic function (‘violent, savage’), and originally meaning ‘take by force’, with ‘capture’ as an extended sense. Note: OBI occurrences of 毌 ‘pierce, penetrate’ are taken in one interpretation as representing a shield, or alternatively as shells (shell currency) pierced and strung together on a length of string (both given in Mizukami). It might be tempting to take the line through the shield as indicating ‘pierce a shield’, but in all cases the line is horizontal or vertical in relation to the shield, suggesting orderly construction rather than invasive piercing (in the latter case, one would tend to expect a diagonal piercing line). N.B. 毌 should be distinguished from another graph very similar in shape, viz. 毋 , originally standing for a word meaning ‘do not violate woman’, then borrowed for ‘there is none, do not…’. 毌 1148 was more distinct in shape in OBI and bronze, while 毋 ‘do not violate woman’ only became distinct in shape from 母 222 ‘mother’ from seal onwards. MS1995:v1:718-20; OT1968:882; GY2008:611,127. For the modern form, we suggest taking the lower part as 男 57 male/man.

Another analysis takes the graph as 思 147 ‘think’, with 虍 1301 (‘tiger’, q.v. 1301) as phonetic with associated sense ‘count, calculate’, giving ‘consider and count’ as original meaning (Katō).

Examples:
  • 了解 [RYŌKAI] - understood!

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Shuowen takes it to be a pictograph of a child with arms withered and twisted, positioned close to the body (torso); this view is followed by Katō. Similarly, Gu sees it as representing an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes, in effect bringing the limbs close to the body. Another scholar sees it as string or cord that has been tied (Ogawa). A more general – and perhaps safer – view of the seal form is that it depicts ‘something twisted’ (Shirakawa). Its modern meanings would seem to be loan usages. KJ1970:920-21; GY2008:17; OT1968:29; SS1984:882. Take as armless infant ( 子 27).

Note: 巤 is taken as meaning ‘mask for frightening demons away’, or ‘animal mane’; both are listed by Mizukami. TA1965:842-5; MS1995:v1:426-7; OT1968:645; KJ1970:924; FC1974:v2:1438.

  • 官僚 [KANRYŌ] - official

Etymology: Seal . Consists of 亻 / 人 41 ‘person’, with 尞 (CO ‘burn’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘work’, giving ‘person who works alongside’ (Katō), or ii] ‘place where officials live’, giving ‘colleagues who are officials’ (Ogawa), or iii] ‘be linked, continue’, giving ‘person who works alongside in same office’ (noted in Mizukami). Mizukami). Sense modified (depending on interpretation of original meaning) to ‘official’, along with ‘colleague’. Mizukami lists proposed OBI equivalents. Note: the OBI forms of 尞 depict a pile of wood (firewood) being burned, giving ‘pile up wood and burn’; the sense was then generalized to ‘burn’. On a cultural note, in ancient China aspirants to a position in officialdom, which was considered an elite occupation, had to sit written examinations largely based on the Confucian classics. That is, they earned their position through hard work and study and merit. By contrast, in early Japan, despite a strong influence from China in a variety of ways, including various political institutions and legal frameworks, examinations for officials were replaced by recommendations, and bureaucrats were largely aristocrats. KJ1995:918-9; OT1968:81; SS1984:885; MS1995:v1:82-3,402-03. Awkward mnemonically, but we suggest taking the elements on the right-side as ‘big’ 大 56, 丷 as ‘away’ 八 70, ‘day/sun’ 日 66, and 小 ‘little’ 38.

Has 疒 404 ‘sick(-bed)’, with 樂 98 (‘music; pleasure’; later, 尞 [see 2092 Note]) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘assess and put right’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘good’ or ‘control’, giving ‘treat illness’ (Katō). According to Shirakawa, the earlier form 𤻲 reflects an ancient Chinese method of treating illness, whereby bells were struck near the patient in order to drive out the demons of sickness; later, after that practice ceased, the phonetic was changed to 尞 . DJ2009:v2:613; OT1968:682; SS1984:888; KJ1970:919. Take 尞 as ‘big’ 大 56, 丷 as ‘away’ 八 70, ‘day/sun’ 日 66, and 小 ‘little’ 38.

Alternatively, 量 is taken as a sack of fixed size for measuring grain, giving ‘provisions of fixed amount’ (Shirakawa). Either view leads to ‘provisions’ and – as a generalized sense – ‘materials’ and ‘measure’. OT1968:765; TA1965:360-62; SS1984:888.

Note: 侖 consists of 亼 ‘collect, bring together’ (originally, pictograph of lid/cover over something [ Shuowen erroneously analyses as three things put together]), over 冊 884 ‘(slim) bound volume’, giving ‘(number of slim) volumes bound together in order’.

Etymology: Seal ( 鄰 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally consists of 邑 / 阝 ‘village, settlement’ (normally right -hand 阝 376, not left -hand 262, which signifies ‘hill, mound’ etc.), combined with 粦 (CO; for meanings, see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘lined up, side by side’, giving ‘village/settlement with dwellings arranged side by side’. By extension, ‘neighboring’ and ‘adjoin’. It is not clear as to when exactly the element 阝 was relocated. Note: 粦 is taken in one view as the modified version of , consisting of 炎 1050 ‘flames’, combined with 舛 336 (‘feet pointed in opposite directions’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘stamp on and scatter’; overall meaning: ‘flames scattered through stamping’, or ‘flickering flames, will-o’-the-wisp’ (Mizukami). Alternatively, based on one of the bronze forms for 粦 , another commentator interprets the top element differently as 大 56 (‘big’) representing ‘person’, and takes the short dot-like strokes as drops of blood dripping down, with overall meaning ‘human sacrifice made before ladder for deities (to descend and ascend)’ (Shirakawa). The latter view is based in part on Shirakawa’s idiosyncratic interpretation of left-hand 阝 (abbreviated form of 阜 1907 when occurring as left-hand element), which is usually taken to mean ‘hill, mound, etc.’. MS1995:v2:1340-41,v1:808-09,796-7; OT1968:1075; TA1965:477-80; SS1984:890-92. Taking modern form, albeit with an error, we suggest 米 ‘rice’ 220, 舛 336 as opposed feet/stamp, and ‘mound’ 阝 .

Etymology: Seal ( 勱 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional: 勱 . Has 力 78 ‘strength, effort’, with 萬 (traditional equivalent for 万 227 ‘ten thousand, myriad’; originally, pictograph of scorpion) as phonetic with associated sense ‘strive’ or similar (Tōdō says ‘apply great stimulus’), giving ‘great effort’. There is also the form 勵 , which seems to be a later variant, with 厲 (NJK,‘whetstone’) as phonetic in place of 萬 ; possibly this evolved as a folk etymology (i.e. erroneous etymology) based on interpreting the meaning of 勱 as deriving from sharpening one’s efforts. Zhengzitong (1771) treats 勵 as a popular variant. 勵 was, though, given official status in Japan in the first Jōyō kanji List of 1923; this was replaced by 励 in the Tōyō kanji list of 1946. MS1995:v2:1124-6; DJ2009:v3:1135; KJ1970:916-17; TA1965:551; KZ2001:268/3671; ZZ1671:v1:180. Take 厂 as cliff, and 力 as ‘strongly’.

<b>戻</b>

Examples:
  • 戻し税 [modoshiZEI] - tax refund
  • 返戻 [HENREI] - return
  • 戻しそう [modoshisō] - feeling sick

Etymology: Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional . The traditional interpretation ( Shuowen ) is that this graph, comprising 犬 19 ‘dog’ with 戸 120 ‘door’, represents a dog twisting and turning to get under a door or entrance, and this is followed by several scholars (Ogawa, Katō). Katō takes ‘go back’ as an extended sense deriving from a dog going back – i.e. return – to its original shape (posture) after getting under a door. However, this proposed Shuowen -based etymology seems questionable. An alternative proposal by Shirakawa takes as showing a dog buried beneath an entrance as a preventative spell. A further analysis treats it as 犬 , with 戸 as phonetic with associated sense ‘shut in’, giving ‘wild/rampaging dog is shut in (by entrance)’, and by extension ‘act contrary to, go against’ (noted in Mizukami). Etymology of this graph is debated; Schuessler has ‘arrive, reach, settle’ as possible meanings for 戻 in a word-family related to 来 237 ‘come’ (as opposed to ‘return’). OT1968:398; KJ1970:1917; SS1984:897; MS1995:v1:546-7; AS2007:342-3. ‘Dog’ has now been replaced by what is in effect ‘big’ 大 56.

Examples:
  • 幽霊 [YŪREI] - ghost

  • 霊屋 [tamaya] - mausoleum

Etymology: Seal ; traditional 靈 . Shuowen has as the main entry, and notes 靈 as an alternative form. Firstly, : this has 王 5 (‘ruler’), but here representing 玉 15 (‘jade, precious stone’; at the seal stage, the two were virtually identical in shape), combined with 霝 , taken here in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘descend, come down’, giving ‘precious stone used by shaman/shamaness to bring deities down’ (noted in Mizukami). The alternative form 靈 has 巫 ‘shaman/shamaness’, with 霝 (‘rain, rain falls’; see 零 2107) as phonetic with associated sense ‘descend’, taken as giving ‘shaman/shamaness for whom fearsome deity descends’ (also listed in Mizukami, with nuance ‘fearsome deity, ghost’ in place of ‘deity’). Alternatively, Ogawa takes 霝 as semantic in function meaning ‘rain’, giving ‘shaman/shamaness prays for rain’. Both and 靈 occur at the clerical script stage; 霊 is based on cursive forms. On a cultural note, Japanese ghosts are traditionally supposed to have no legs. MS1995:v2:860-62; DJ2009:v1:30; OT1968:1087; SK1984:773; FC1974:v2:2418-20. Take as variant of 並 977 ‘line up’, along with 雨 3 ‘rain’.

Examples:
  • 奴隷 [DOREI] - slave
  • 奴隷制 [DOREISEI] - slavery
  • 隷属 [REIZOKU] - subordination

Etymology: Seal ( 隸 ) ; traditional 隸 . Consists of 隶 ‘catch up with’ 1668 (see Note below), with 柰 (original meaning [provisional]: ‘quince’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘join, bind, make into a pair’, giving ‘capture and make into slave/servant’ and hence ‘slave, prisoner’. Also used in Qin and Han dynasties as a term for low-ranking officials in charge of prisoners. The script used (though not actually devised) by them for administrative purposes, significantly abbreviated from the seal script, came to be known as 隷書 REISHO (Ch. lishu ), usually in English called ‘clerical script’ or ‘scribe script’. Clerical script represents an important stage in the historical development of the Chinese script. Clerical script occurrences of this graph have both 隸 and 隷 ; historically speaking, the latter is a variant form, but now the standard in Japanese usage. Note: several scholars give a pre-seal form, but its status is questionable, and so we take the seal form as the correct early form (as does Katō). MS1995:v2:1404-5; KJ1970:916; QX2000:103-112. Suggest taking 隶 as 肀 hand seizing, 氺 as (sweat) droplets, and left-hand as 士 ‘samurai’ 521 and 示 ‘show’ 723.

  • 高齢 [KŌREI] - great age

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ); traditional 齡 . Consists of 齒 ‘teeth’ (traditional form of 歯 306), combined with 令 633 (‘order, rule’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘count’, giving ‘count teeth and determine age’ (Katō); meaning later narrowed to ‘age’. Shirakawa notes that the age of cattle is easily ascertained by checking their teeth. Another scholar (Ogawa) analyses the graph differently, taking 齒 as ‘age, years’ (presumably as extended sense), with 令 as phonetic with associated sense ‘pass, elapse’, giving overall meaning ‘age’. Note that the modern form has the simplified version of the graph for ‘teeth’, i.e. 歯 , with inner shape the same as ‘rice’ 米 220. KJ1970:915; OT1968:1173; SS1984:900. We suggest taking the modern left-hand form(s) as ‘rice’ 米 220 in the ‘mouth’ 口 22, and 止 143 ‘stop’, and for the right-hand retaining 令 as ‘order’ 633.

Examples:
  • 暦年 [REKINEN] - calendar year
  • 西暦 [SEIREKI] - Anno Domini
  • 花暦 [hanagoyomi] - floral clock

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ); traditional 曆 . In one view, analyzed as consisting of 日 66 ‘sun, day’, with 厤 (CO; ‘divide up evenly/carefully’ – see 歴 636 ‘history, path’, and for 秝 see Note below) taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘walk with regular intervals’, giving ‘sun moves with regular intervals’ (Katō). In similar vein, Ogawa takes 厤 as phonetic with associated sense ‘divide up equally’, to give ‘(device) for counting by arranging/setting out days’, i.e. ‘calendar’. According to Qiu, 曆 was devised to represent unambiguously in writing the word for‘calendar’, which had until then been represented using 歴 636 (path/movement followed by sun and other heavenly bodies at regular intervals). Shirakawa, by contrast, puts forward several proposed bronze forms for 曆 /暦 which feature not 日 ‘sun, day’ but 曰 1048 ‘speak’, which he interprets as ‘announce on banner military prowess at camp gates’. The form 暦 , now standard in Japanese usage, evolved as relatively late variant (block script stage). Note: 秝 (CO; reduplication of 禾 87 ‘grain plant’) is taken in one view as ‘arrange grain seedlings equidistantly’ or ‘arranged properly’ (Mizukami). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes 秝 to represent grain plants placed to mark the entrance to a military camp. KJ1970:921; OT1968:474; MS1995:v1:186-7,v2:966-7; QX2000:357; OT1968:474; SS1984:902-3.

Etymology: Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 力 78 ‘strength’ combined with 少 160 ‘few, little’, giving in one view ‘strength diminished, less strength’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Another commentator (Katō) considers ‘bend’ to be a connotation, giving ‘bend easily due to poor strength’, and by extension ‘weak’. Either way, ‘inferior’ is an extended sense.

Note 1: one bronze form of shows hand over three skeins of silk thread, seen as ‘untangle thread’; some bronze/seal forms have 絲 ‘silk’ (two skeins of silk thread), with 言 (‘words’ 118) as phonetic with associated sense ‘tangled’ &gt; ‘(silk) thread gets tangled’, or ‘unravel tangled thread’ (given in Mizukami). Note 2: the associated senses given by Ogawa and Tōdō relate to the form of this graph with heart 心 164, but have been applied here also to earlier equivalent with 女 .

Has 雨 3 ‘rain’, with 路 439 (‘road’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘condense’, giving ‘weather element that condenses’ – in this case a reference to rain-like ‘dew’. Gu suggests ‘expose’ is an extended sense based on dew forming outside where there is no obstruction to stop it forming; perhaps best seen as tentative. ‘Small’ may be extended sense from droplet. Also used in Japanese (written style) for its sound value for ‘Russia’. KJ1970:191; AS2007:366; GY2008:2015-16.

Originally used to denote a village in the ancient Chinese state of Lu. The meaning ‘male’ derives from use of underlying word by women in ancient China to refer to husband, later becoming extended in meaning. In Japanese, typically occurs as a suffix in some male given names (e.g. 太郎 Tarō). KJ1970:539-40; TA1965:361. Take as ‘variant ‘good’ 良 .

Note: NJK 婁 is taken in one view as 女 37 ‘woman’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘shamaness, consult with shamaness’ (apparently a hunchback shamaness). Mizukami also notes a different view of 婁 as meaning ‘capture and link women together’. Schuessler gives original sense of 婁 as ‘mound’, and also notes possible link with ‘hunchbacked’.

Shuowen defines 漏 as ‘clepsydra’ (water-clock), which is an extended sense based on dripping of water being a simple means of measuring time. GY2008:1759-60; MS1995:v1:412-3; OT1968:606.

Consists of 貝 10 ‘shellfish, shell money’, with 有 423 (‘have’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘force on (someone)’ or ‘make a gift’, thus ‘make a gift of money’ (Katō), or ii] ‘put forward’, thus ‘make gift of valuables’ (Ogawa), or iii] ‘keep, store’, giving ‘valuables which are stored’ (Tōdō). A negative connotation evolved later from the basic meaning ‘provide’, leading to the sense ‘bribe’. KJ1970:933; OT1968:958; TA1968:139-43; GY2008:1056.

Etymology: Seal ( 脅 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Shuowen has 脅 , consisting of 月 209 (‘flesh, meat; body’), with 劦 (‘combined strength, put together’ [&lt; 力 ‘strength’ 78]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hold between, insert between’, giving ‘either side of stomach between elbows’, i.e. ‘side (of torso)’, and by extension ‘armpit’. A further extended sense is ‘threaten’, based on the concept of being enclosed on both sides, and to represent this meaning unambiguously there later arose the convention of writing the constituent elements differently, as 脅 1225 (q.v.). The meaning of ‘threaten’ for 2132 is no longer in use. KJ1970:360; GY2008:680-81; TA1965:860-62.
