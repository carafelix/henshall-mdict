一	ICHI, ITSU, hito-	one	L5	1	1	一月 [ICHIGATSU] - January; 均一 [KIN’ITSU] - uniformity; 一人 [hitori*] - one person	A simple single stroke to represent ‘one’. Unsurprisingly, a similar convention was employed in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and in Sumerian cuneiform. References: SS1984:27; QX2000:32.	ONE FINGER	
右	U, YŪ, migi	right	L5	2	5	右派 [UHA] - rightist faction; 左右 [SAYŪ] - control; 右手 [migite] - right hand	Originally represented by , a stylized sketch of a hand. Other early but more complex forms show a hand on the right-hand side of what is widely interpreted as a mouth or – in a minority view (Shirakawa) – a ritual vessel / 口 22 . References: SS1984:36; BK1957:261-2; KJ1970:38; AS2007:581-2.	RIGHT HAND TO THE MOUTH	images/48a.jpg; images/48b.jpg
雨	U, ame, ama-	rain	L5	3	8	雨季 [UKI] - rainy season; 大雨 [ōame] - heavy rain; 雨雲 [amagumo] - rain cloud	OBI . Based on a conceptual depiction of rain, falling from the sky which is represented by a top horizontal line, though this line is often missing in the OBI and bronze forms. The graph can also indicate weather elements. References: SS1984:38; QX2000:208.	RAIN FROM HEAVENLY CLOUDS	images/48c.jpg
円	EN, maru	round, yen	L5	4	4	円形 [ENKEI] - circle; 百円 [HYAKUEN] - hundred yen	The modern simplified form of 圓 , a relatively late graph ( Shuowen ) which consists of 囗 (regularized shape for ‘circle’) with 員 248 (‘official’, originally ‘cauldron’) as phonetic; included by Tōdō in word-family meaning ‘round; surround’. 円 may be based on a cursive form of 圓 . References: YK1976:69; TA1965:63-4. We suggest taking the graph as resembling a bank teller’s window.		
王	Ō	king, ruler	L3	5	4	王子 [ŌJI] - prince; 女王 [JOŌ] - queen; 王様 [Ōsama] - king	OBI shows this graph to be based on a battle-ax blade. Shirakawa feels the OBI and bronze equivalents show a ritual blade of a type used only by those of high status such as a ruler. Qiu notes that at the seal script stage the character 王 and another separate character meaning ‘jewel’ were written so similarly that they could easily be confused, so a dot was added later for clarity when writing ‘jewel’ (see 玉 15). References: SS1984:62-3; QX2000:46.	KING RULES WITH AN AX	images/48d.jpg
音	ON, IN, oto, ne	sound	L4	6	9	音楽 [ONGAKU] - music; 子音 [SHIIN] - consonant; 発音 [HATSUON] - pronunciation	Precise etymology disputed. Early bronze equivalent . The lower element is interpreted either as a mouth (Karlgren, Katō) or as a prayer receptacle. Shirakawa takes the latter view, and maintains that the (extra) horizontal stroke inside the receptacle represents a written prayer. Katō regards 音 and 言 (see ‘word’, 118) as having been used interchangeably in ancient times, though Karlgren treats them as having been separate. References: BK1957:173, 80; KJ1970:68; SS1984:68. We suggest taking 立 as ‘rising’ 77 and 日 as ‘sun’ 66.	SOUND OF THE RISING SUN	images/49a.jpg
下	KA, GE, shita, moto, shimo, sa	under, lower	L5	7	3	下品 [GEHIN] - vulgarity; 低下 [TEIKA] - decrease; 川下 [kawashimo] - downstream	OBI . Mizukami suggests the curve was to help distinguish this character from early forms of 二 65 (‘two’). At some point, a vertical stroke was added beneath the longer horizontal. Qiu feels this change was also for graphic distinction – in this case from the early forms of 上 39 (‘above’), which was written with a short horizontal stroke over a longer one to represent ‘go up, above’. Shirakawa takes the longer horizontal line in early forms as depicting the palm of the hand (in profile). References: BK1957:28; QX2000:46; MS1983:151; SS1984:69.	T-BAR WITH DROOPY LOWER HANDLE UNDERNEATH	images/49b.jpg
火	KA, hi	fire	L5	8	4	火曜日 [KAYŌbi] - Tuesday; 火山 [KAZAN] - volcano; 火花 [hibana] - spark	OBI shows it to be based on a stylized sketch of a burning fire. As a lower determinative / element, it typically occurs as 灬 . References: SS1984:70; KJ1970:953-4.	FLAMES OF FIRE	images/49c.jpg
花	KA, hana	flower, blossom	L4	9	7	花弁 [KABEN] - petal; 花見 [hanami] - blossom viewing; 花火 [hanabi] - fireworks	A late character. The top element is the typical abbreviation 艹 of the ‘plant’ determinative 艸 53 (itself based on a pictograph of plants growing), while the lower element 化 ‘change’ (see 258), serves as phonetic (associated sense here disputed), and is a pointer to the reading, which in modern Sino-Japanese is KA (also a phonetic indicator in 貨 KA 455, etc.). According to Shirakawa, the graph 花 was probably not devised in China until the early 5th century AD; Katō gives a wider timeframe, viz the Six Dynasties period (ca. 222-589AD).

空	KŪ, sora, kara	sky, empty	L5	17	8	空気 [KŪKI] - air; 空色 [sorairo] - sky-blue; 空箱 [karabako] - empty box	Bronze . The top five strokes (of the modern form) depict the entrance to a hollowed-out pit, or cave 穴 860, i.e., something empty; subsequently extended to mean ‘sky’. The lower element 工 125 (‘work, tool’) serves as a phonetic, with an associated sense of ‘hole’. References: SS1984:220; KJ1970:401; MS1995:v2:974-5. We suggest remembering by using 工 in its meaning of ‘work’.	WORK TO OPEN THE ROOF TO SEE THE EMPTY SKY	images/51d.jpg

犬	KEN, inu	dog	L4	19	4	猟犬 [RYŌKEN] - hunting-dog; 犬小屋 [inugoya] - kennel; 子犬 [koinu] - puppy	Based on pictograph of a dog rearing up . Occurs also in the form 犭 as a left-hand determinative, sometimes in characters for other animals. References: QX2000:65-67; SS1984:254. We suggest remembering it by taking it as 大 56 ‘big’ plus a spot.		images/52c.jpg

According to Qiu, 强 (a variant of 強 ; standard in PRC usage) originally refers to type of ‘insect’ 虫 60, but came to be used as substitute for another graph of more complex shape, i.e. 彊 . In part, this was because pronunciation for the two words concerned in early Chinese represented by 強 / 强 and 彊 was identical, if we accept Schuessler’s reconstruction of sound values. Latter graph is made up of 弓 ’bow’ 107 and two ‘field’ graphs 田 63 with three straight dividing lines (note that as independent graph this component here had the sense of ‘boundary’). The meaning of 彊 , first found in OBI texts, is tentatively taken as ‘strong bow’ by Tōdō, who sees ‘unmoving’ – and thereby ‘strong’ – as extended senses of ‘boundary’. As for 弓 , it is thought that the bow, being of standard length, may have had the additional role of being a convenient tool for making land measurements.

Has 彡 ‘color, brush pattern’ (etc.) (determinative no. 59), and left-hand element identical with or close in shape to 井 1575 ‘well’. In one view, taken as consisting of 彡 meaning ‘writing brush hairs’, and 开 as phonetic with associated sense ‘imitate, model after’, giving ‘model, copy’ (Katō). Another analysis treats as 彡 ‘pattern’, and 开 / 井 as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘square frame’, giving ‘mold (to make copies)’ (Tōdō). Shirakawa also sees 开 / 井 as representing a frame or mold.

Seal form has 糸 29 ‘thread’ as semantic, and 囟 (CO originally a pictograph of skull or fontanelle) as phonetic, with associated sense ‘thin, slender’. The change from 囟 to 田 in standard script is due either to script regularization or mistaken analysis. KJ1970:469; YK1976:198; SS1984:338. We suggest taking 田 as 63 ‘field’.

Some bronze forms have a hand appended; later this was dropped, and the ‘person’ determinative 亻 41 was added. ‘To make’ evolved as an extended meaning. As the phonetic in 作 , 乍 also has associated sense of ‘modified, not genuine’ (cf English ‘made up’). MS1995:v1:18-20, 54; KJ1970:435-6; OT1968:25,53. We suggest taking 乍 as a saw.

寺	JI, tera	temple	L3	149	6	竜安寺 [RYŌANJI] - Ryoan Temple; 寺院 [JIIN] - Buddhist temple; 山寺 [yamadera] - mountain temple	Mizukami takes bronze forms to combine ‘hand’ 920 寸 orig. ‘hand’, with 止 143 ‘stop’, latter acting as phonetic with associated sense ‘control’; Katō broadly agrees. Ogawa identifies same two elements as ‘keep in the hand’. Instead of 止 , Tōdō takes top element as 之 (NJK; ‘move, go’, see 151). Note some OBI and bronze forms of 止 and 之 are very similar ( 之 might originally have depicted foot, like 止 ); Karlgren asserts 止 ‘is mostly used in the bone and the bronze inscriptions as loan for the homophonous 之 in its various meanings’ (Schuessler has these two graphs as near-homophones, not complete homophones in Late Han times). Originally meaning ‘control with hand’, in Han times 寺 acquired the sense of ‘place to control/administer’, and also – after transmission of Buddhism to China c.1 st century A.D. – the more specialized sense of ‘Buddhist temple’. By clerical script stage upper element had changed to 土 . MS1995:v1:392-3,18-19; KJ1970:480; OT1968:285; BK1957:253-4; AS2007:613; SK1984:230. Take as 土 64 ‘ground’ and 寸 920 ‘hand’.

Shirakawa, though, takes the graph as originally depicting a woman with a chignon, which is then dishevelled by someone’s hands ( 攵 ) to denote ‘blame, reproach’ (now a minor meaning in Chinese). MS1995:v1:582-3,336-7; KJ1970:499; SS1984:490-91. We suggest taking the modern form as 米 220 ‘rice’, 女 37 ‘woman’, and ‘use of hands’ 攵 112.	WOMAN COUNTS NUMBER OF RICE GRAINS BY HAND	images/87a.jpg

In one view, 壴 ‘big drum’ over 至 886 (‘arrive’) with the sense ‘foot, base’ gives ‘drum stand’ (Ogawa). In another view, upper element is taken as ‘watchtower’ over 至 meaning ‘stay’, giving ‘place to stay and watch out’, i.e. ‘watchtower’ (Mizukami). Later abbreviated shape 台 coincides with a separate graph 台 (originally ‘I, me’ [ 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, and 厶 ‘enclose and make one’s own’ as phonetic meaning ‘oneself’]).

Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and 矢 145 (‘arrow’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit the mark’, giving ‘describe spot-on/exactly (like a flying arrow to its target)’, and by extension ‘know’. Alternatively, Shirakawa takes ‘arrow’ as being linked to taking an oath to the deities, and interprets 口 22 in his more usual way as ‘receptacle’; ‘knowing’ is then taken as emerging from the process of oath-taking. 智 is a separate graph (NJK) also meaning ‘know’; lower element is originally not 日 66 ‘sun, day’, but NJK 曰 ‘speak’.

An abbreviated form of the graph, with its modern structure, is found from the seal script stage, consisting of 子 27 ‘child’ but inverted, over 肉 209 ‘meat, flesh’ in its abbreviated form 月 , possibly as phonetic with associated sense ‘to be born’ (Yamada, Katō), but Tōdō considers 月 here to be semantic only. ‘Be raised/raise’ and ‘educate’ are extended meanings.

As in the seal form ( Shuowen ) and modern form, the lower element might appear to be 貝 10 ‘shell currency’, which is incorrect but may be a helpful mnemonic. The top element 口 22 ‘round’ is semantic, and Tōdō takes it in this role only; Mizukami, Katō, and Yamada choose to take it as phonetic with associated meaning ‘round’, as well as semantic. ‘Member’ and ‘official’ appear to be modern meanings.

Seal form onwards consists of 氵 42 ‘water’, with as phonetic; generally, taken as associated sense unclear and the whole graph originally representing a specific river name, then loaned for ‘warm’. Mizukami, however, lists the above OBI forms as showing someone with water in a bath-like container, regards associated sense of the phonetic as ‘warm’, and takes the meaning as ‘river with warm current’ or ‘steamy warm water’. He also treats the same OBI form as the earliest form of 浴 625 ‘bathe’, listing different shapes for 温 and 浴 only at the seal stage. MS1995:V2,772-3; KJ1970:114; YK1976:76. We suggest taking the modern graph as 氵 42 ‘water’, 日 66 ‘sun’, and 皿 300 ‘bowl’.	SUN WARMS WATER IN A BOWL	images/Chapter3_img_23.jpg; images/Chapter3_img_24.jpg; images/Chapter3_img_25.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, with right-hand side as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Originally referred to the Han River (modern Shaanxi Province), one of the most important tributaries of the Yangtze River; later taken as name for the Han dynasty by its founder Liu Bang, as that region was where he began building the dynasty. At an early period, non-Han ethnic groups in China referred to Han Chinese as 漢 子 ‘sons of Han’, and by extension the general sense ‘male’. KJ1970:223; OT1968:599; YK1976:104; SS1984:128. We suggest taking the right hand element as 夫 601 ‘man’, 口 22 ‘mouth’ and 艹 53 ‘grass/plant’, with a little geographical licence.

Upper part is early form of 及 1202 (‘reach, extend’), acting here as phonetic with associated sense such as ‘become tense, brace’. ‘Sudden’ is an extended meaning. SS1984:174; YK1976:125; OT1968:363.

Generally taken as 矢 145 ‘arrow’, with element for flagpole and streamer (modern form / : see also CO 斿 at 424) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sharp, pointed’. Originally meant ‘arrowhead’. ‘Family’ is a loan usage, and when this meaning became dominant, the metal determinative 金 16 was added to create a new graph 鏃 for ‘arrowhead’. MS1995:v1:604-5; KJ1970:649-50; YK1976:336. We suggest taking 方 as 223 ‘side’, and as 41 ‘person’.

第	DAI	grade, order	L3	359	11	第二課 [DAINIKA] - Lesson Two; 次第に [SHIDAI ni] - gradually; 及第 [KYŪDAI] - making grade	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and a slightly abbreviated form of 弟 194 (‘younger brother’; qv) as phonetic with associated sense ‘order, sequence’, to give original meaning ‘put letters or records in order’. It subsequently acquired more general meaning of ‘order, sequence’, probably with a connotation of relative status, given other related words in Chinese noted by Schuessler such as those for ‘younger brother’ and possibly also ‘ladder’. Note: In Han times, strips of bamboo were commonly joined together – clearly reflected in the shape of the graph 冊 884 ‘bundle of bamboo tablets’ – to give a surface for writing.

Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 是 1574 (now ‘proper’, ‘this’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shave the head’; shaving the head gives impression of bigger forehead, hence the original meaning ‘forehead’. In ancient China, slaves’ foreheads were marked (tattooed) with a sign to show ownership, and from that there evolved the extended sense ‘title, heading’. KJ1970:712-3; YK1976:348; MS1995:v2:1450-51.

炭	TAN, sumi	charcoal, coal	L4	361	9	石炭 [TANSEKI] - coal; 炭素 [TANSO] - carbon; 炭火 [sumibi] - charcoal fire	Seal . Generally taken as 火 8 ‘fire’ and 屵 as phonetic element with associated sense ‘return, go back’. Charcoal is wood that has been burned once (under controlled conditions) but can be burned again as fuel, hence the two graphic elements together meaning ‘fire returns’. As well as this interpretation, Mizukami sets out an alternative, taking 屵 semantically as ‘cliff, bluff’, to give ‘combustible material coming from a cliff or similar’, i.e. coal (as extended sense; also in modern Chinese [certain non-Mandarin dialects], 炭 can mean ‘coal’).

短	TAN, mijika	short	L3	362	12	短所 [TANSHO] - shortcoming; 短気 [TANKI] - short tempered; 手短に [temijika ni] - in brief	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Katō and Yamada choose to take 矢 145 ‘arrow’ as an abbreviation of the NJK 矩 ‘carpenter’s square’, with 豆 379 (‘upright vessel’, now ‘bean’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘small’, to give overall meaning such as ‘small in measure, short in stature’. Ogawa, though, takes 矢 literally as ‘arrow’, and 豆 as phonetic with associated sense ‘small’, to give ‘short arrow’. Either way, the resultant meaning evolved as just ‘short’.

Has 言 118 ‘words, language’, and 炎 1050 ‘leaping flames’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘peaceful’, to give original meaning ‘say things in a peaceful way’, and possibly having a sense of warmth.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 主 315 (now ‘main/master’ but originally a stemmed lamp) as phonetic with associated sense ‘continue’, to give meaning ‘continuation of water droplets’ (Katō, Ogawa). An alternative analysis is given by Tōdō, who includes 注 in his word-family ‘stand firmly/upright’ on the basis that water pouring down can be seen as a vertical column. The early meaning of 主 is stemmed lamp, and this may reinforce ‘column’. KJ1970:506-7; YK1976:362; OT1968:567; TA1965:281-4.	MASTER POURS WATER IN A COLUMN, AND TAKES NOTES	images/134a.jpg

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 主 315 (‘main’, originally a stemmed lamp) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stand firmly’; in Tōdō’s word-family ‘stand firmly/upright’.

帳	CHŌ	register, drape	L1	368	11	手帳 [teCHŌ] - notebook; 帳場 [CHŌba] - counter, desk; 蚊帳 [kaya*] - mosquito net	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Generally taken as 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, with 長 189 ‘long’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull taut’ (later 張 775), originally referring to a curtain pulled around a bed as a screen; Tōdō, in contrast, includes 帳 in a word-family meaning ‘long’, to give ‘long hanging cloth’. Not clear whether the sense ‘record book/accounts book’ is an extended usage (records written on cloth?) or a loan usage. KJ1970:702-3; YK1976:366; OT1968:318; TA1965:348-9.

Has 言 118 ‘words, language’, and 周 532 (‘around’), here as phonetic with associated sense ‘harmonise’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘extend thoroughly’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Though these two interpretations of the phonetic differ, the former is in line with the modern Japanese meaning totonoeru ‘arrange’, the latter with shiraberu ‘investigate’.

Has 广 127 ‘house, building’, and 廷 1742 (‘imperial court’), here as phonetic with associated sense ‘extend/spread in a straight line/evenly’ (Mizukami, Tōdō). Originally, the building was typically a palace, and the graph referred to a level open space in a courtyard where people often gathered for formal occasions. Used with a similar meaning historically in Japan, but then also came to denote ‘garden’. MS1995:454-5; TA1965:455-59; OT1968:329.	PALACE COURTYARD HAS FINE COVERED GARDEN	images/Chapter3_img_194.jpg

Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 由 421 (‘reason’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘extract’ (Tōdō, Ogawa) or ‘clear’ (Katō); Tōdō takes it as extracting the material from inside the bamboo joints to make it hollow, while Katō takes as meaning a flute which produces clear sound. TA1965:185-90; OT1968:749; KJ1970:720.	THERE’S A REASON WHY BAMBOO IS USED AS A FLUTE	images/Chapter3_img_195.jpg; images/60e.jpg

Generally taken as 金 16 ‘metal’, with (CO ‘big’) (the minor change from 大 56 [‘big’] in top of seal form to 十 35 [‘ten’] in block script is not significant) as phonetic with associated sense range ‘black soil, black, reddish-black’ (Mizukami, Yamada, Ogawa), though Katō regards the right-hand element as having semantic and phonetic role, meaning ‘big’. In favour of interpretation of right-hand element as ‘black, reddish black’ here is the existence of a related word in Chinese of the same or similar pronunciation represented by the graph 驖 meaning ‘reddish-black horse’. The black or reddish-black metal is usually taken as ‘iron’, which takes on a reddish-black colour when rusted. MS1995:v2:1378-9; YK1976:377; OT1968:1040; KJ1970:723; ZY2009:v4:1560.

Taken as 又 2003 ‘hand’, with abbreviated form of 庶 1480 (‘many’) (Katō, Yamada, Tōdō) – or variant of 石 47 (‘stone’) – (Ogawa) as a phonetic, both with ngers of same associated sense ‘spread out fingers of the hand’, to give ‘measure with the hand’. The hand, with spread-out thumb and middle finger, was moved from one point to the next as a rough way of measuring a short distance. Later took on a generalized meaning ‘measure’ and not just linear, hence ‘degree’, etc. KJ1970:612; YK1976:383-4; TA1965:332-5; OT1968:156. We suggest taking 广 127 as ‘building’ and central part as two ‘tens’ 十 35 with ‘one’ 一 1.	HAND MEASURES TWENTY-ONE DEGREES IN BUILDING	images/Chapter3_img_200.jpg

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 殳 170 (originally hand holding stick) as phonetic with associated sense ‘throw (stick)’ (Ogawa); Shirakawa also sees 殳 as stick/baton, as weapon.

豆	TŌ, ZU, mame	beans, miniature	L1	379	7	豆腐 [TŌFU] - tofu (beancurd); 大豆 [DAIZU] - soybean; 豆本 [mameHON] - miniature book	OBI form ; seal . Originally a pictograph of a round vessel on a stem (varied in height) with a splayed foot, to serve meat or other food; later, some such vessels (Ch. dou ) served a ritual purpose. In Tōdō’s word-family ‘stand upright’. The graph seems to have been borrowed to represent a different word (of same pronunciation in Han times) meaning ‘bean, soybean’; the meaning ‘small’ may be an extended use from ‘bean’ (something small).

島	TŌ, shima	island	L3	380	10	列島 [RETTŌ] - archipelago; 島民 [TŌMIN] - islanders; 島国 [shimaguni] - island nation	Seal ; this is a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 山 26 ‘mountain’, and (abbreviated shape for 鳥 190 ‘bird’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘big waves’, to give ‘mountains (or other land projecting up) surrounded by sea’, namely ‘island’.

Has 58 ‘bamboo’, here denoting bamboo writing tablet, and 寺 149 (‘temple’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘arrange, put in order’. Similar to 第 359 ‘order’, but regarding the additional sense ‘equal’ which 等 has, Shirakawa cites a pre-modern Chinese commentary which explains this on the basis of sorting out big and small bamboo writing tablets, resulting in groups of tablets of equal size; if we accept this explanation, ‘etc. (et cetera)’ – meaning the inclusion of further similar items – can be regarded as an extended sense.

Has 力 78 ‘strength, power’, and 重 326 (‘heavy’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake’, to give meaning ‘exert power’, and by extension ‘move’. YK1976:391; KJ1970:704; OT1968:128.

童	DŌ, warabe	child	L3	385	12	童話 [DŌWA] - nursery tale; 児童 [JIDŌ] - children; 童心 [DŌSHIN] - child’s mind	Bronze . Seal . Bronze form has 辛 1535 ‘needle’ over 重 326 (‘heavy’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘slave’, also with 目 76 ‘eye’ added in the middle. In ancient China, slaves were tattooed on the forehead with a needle to indicate ownership, and ‘eye’ here is taken to denote forehead, the eye being much easier to represent pictographically. There is debate over this graph’s diff erent meanings ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’. Qiu observes that in ancient texts 童 represented both ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’, and that by the time of Shuowen the NJK graph 僮 had been devised to create the orthographically contrastive pair 童 ‘slave, servant’ as opposed to 僮 ‘child’, but even after that 童 was still often used for ‘child’, and likewise 僮 has meanings of both ‘child’ and ‘servant’. In early Chinese, the associated words for ‘slave, servant’ and ‘child’ appear to have been of the same pronunciation, assuming they were in fact separate words (Schuessler lists them together as one entry). Aesthetically a displeasing graph at bronze stage because it consists of multiple elements one on top of the other; this visual imbalance became moderated at the seal script stage. MS1995:v2:984-5; KJ1970:735; YK1976:392; QX2000:350-51; AS2007:500. Take modern graph as 立 77 ‘stand’ and 里 238 ‘village’.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 咅 (a CO meaning ‘spit’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘oppose, rebel’. Original meaning of the graph is ‘oppose, rebel’, but Tōdō gives a classical reference to support the sense ‘multiply’, as does Schuessler. KJ1970:758-9; YK1976:411-2; OT1968:71; TA1965:158; AS2007:159. We suggest taking 咅 as 77 立 ‘ stand’ and 22 口 ‘open mouth’.	PERSON STANDS OPEN-MOUTHED AT DOUBLE	images/Chapter3_img_222.jpg
箱	hako	box	L3	390	15	小箱 [kobako] - little box; 箱舟 [hakobune] - ark; 箱入り [hakoiri] - boxed	Seal ; a relatively late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 相 348 (‘mutual’) as a phonetic with associated sense ‘face each other’, which is taken as referring to the long rails on either side of an oxcart. The graph 箱 was originally used to denote the part of an ox-cart used for carrying goods (Katō, Shirakawa), and since this was box-like in shape, by extension the meaning ‘box’ evolved.

Has 心 164 ‘heart, mind’, and 非 794 (originally bird wings, meaning ‘oppose’, and by extension ‘deny; wrong’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sad, misery, grief’. The overall meaning ‘sad, misery’ can be understood as ‘opposing/conflicted feelings’. YK1976:424; KJ1970:797; SS1984:713.	MY HEART HAS WINGS – YET I AM SAD!	images/Chapter3_img_236.jpg

Has 自 , originally a pictograph of the nose, and 畀 (CO, originally ‘arrow with big head’) as phonetic with associated sense in dispute: ‘stick out’ (Yamada, Ogawa), or ‘two things are together’ (Mizukami, Tōdō), or ‘naturally draw in and expel air’ (Mizukami). MS1995:v2:1522-3; YK1976:425; OT1968:1171. Suggest 自 as ‘nose’, 田 as 田 63 ‘field’, and lower part as two ‘tens’ 十 35.	OWN NOSE FOLLOWS TRAIL THROUGH TWENTY FIELDS	images/Chapter3_img_239.jpg

The function of the element 毛 is disputed: taken either as phonetic with associated sense ‘envelop, enclose’, to give ‘outer garment to cover inside’ (Katō, Mizukami, Yamada), or as semantic and interpreted as a garment worn over a fur coat (Mizukami, Qiu). The meanings ‘front, surface; show’ are extended usages. KJ1970:843-4; MS1995:v2:1164-5; YK1976:427; QX2000:20. Suggest take the top part as odd variant of ‘master’ 主 315, with ‘clothing’ 衣 .

Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant/cereal’, and 少 160 (‘few, little’) taken either as phonetic and semantic meaning ‘small’ (Ogawa), or as phonetic with associated sense ‘slender, thin’ (Yamada) or ‘ear (of cereal)’ – again, something small – (Katō). The sense ‘small’ was then extended to small units, giving ‘second’ in the dimension of time. KJ1970:847; YK1976:429; OT1968:731.	A LITTLE BIT OF CEREAL EATEN IN A SECOND	images/Chapter3_img_243.jpg

Has 疒 ‘(sick-) bed’ (the ‘sickness’ determinative, based on a person resting on a bed), and 丙 1932 (originally, probably chopping board used in rituals, now ‘third class’), as phonetic with associated sense ‘be added’, to give ‘illness which gets worse’.

Has right-hand determinative 阝 376 (full form: 邑 ), ‘village, settlement’, and 咅 ‘spit’ (see 389), here as phonetic with disputed associated sense. Katō and Yamada feel sense unclear as originally 部 was a proper noun for a tribe in western China, and treat it as loan usage for ‘part, section’. Tōdō, however, includes 部 in a word-family ‘oppose; divide’, linking it to a word later written 剖 1975 ‘cut, split open’. Shirakawa also takes the sense as ‘divide’. KJ1970:759; YK1976:435; TA1965:155-8; SS1984:745-6. Suggest taking 咅 as 立 77 ‘stand’ and 口 22 ‘mouth’.	STAND OPEN-MOUTHED AT PART OF THE VILLAGE ON THE RIGHT	images/Chapter3_img_247.jpg

(originally a woman striving to give birth; now meaning ‘avoid, escape’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘be born’. Along the same lines, Tōdō notes 免 as the original way of writing NJK 娩 ‘childbirth’, and includes it in the word-family ‘take out/produce with great effort’. The graph 勉 thus has the meaning ‘make an effort, strive’. KJ1970:854; YK1976:449; TA1965:739-41.	STRIVE STRONGLY TO ESCAPE	images/146a.jpg

Katō and Yamada treat as originally same graph as 西 169 (later divergence in shape), showing basket/bag for pressing out liquid in wine-making. Shirakawa sees early forms of 由 as the same as for 卣 (‘small-necked wine jar’), which he takes as initially showing a fleshy gourd that produced a form of oil (see 油 422 ‘oil’). Ogawa also treats 卣 and 由 as having same early forms. Differences in analysis of early forms of 由 reflect difficulties often found in deciding which old forms correspond to which modern graphs. The abstract meanings for 由 such as ‘from’ may be taken as loan usages. KJ1970:24; YK1976:476; SS1984:829; OT1968:669,144. Take as 田 63 ‘field’ and l as a drill.

Katō and Mizukami follow the view in Shuowen that the tail is shown also, though the longish line in some OBI occurrences could represent the body instead. In compound graphs, the shortened form is often used. MR2007:293-4; YK1976:482; KJ1970:875; MS1995:v2:1038-9.

In Tōdō’s word-family ‘thin’. He suggests that the (lesser and now rare) sense ‘generation, age’ is a metaphoric use based on layers of leaves one on top of the other.

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and what is generally taken as 羕 (originally pictograph of big river with tributaries) as phonetic. Yamada takes 羕 as having associated sense ‘resemble’, and Katō says it may have this meaning, but despite the connection with appearance, both consider ‘appearance/form’ as loan usage. Ogawa takes 樣 to be a variant of the NJK 橡 ‘horse chestnut’ or ‘oak’, and likewise takes 様 as a loan for ‘appearance’. As for the use of 様 for‘ –sama ’ as a polite suffix, there was an independent Japanese word sama ‘condition/appearance/shape’, found from about the tenth century, sometimes written as 様 , and its use in modern Japanese for ‘ –sama ’ as a suffix may be regarded as a loan usage. YK1976:485; KJ1970:875; OT1968:519. We suggest taking the elements as 木 73 ‘tree’, 羊 426 ‘sheep’, and 水 42 ‘water’.	SHEEP APPEARS TO WATER TREE – AWKWARD SITUATION	images/Chapter3_img_293.jpg

Originally meant ‘split into two’, then took on more generalised sense ‘two’. Shuowen takes it instead as pictographically representing a pair of scales, but modern scholars consider this analysis carries no weight – though perhaps useful as a mnemonic.

Seal form onwards has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 䩑 (CO; OBI and bronze forms of the latter are typically taken as originally a pictograph showing wine being strained and dripping down), the latter as phonetic with associated sense ‘verdigris’, including its color. (Verdigris is a bluish-green coating which comes out of copper and forms on its surface; later written 録 640 qv [the meaning ‘record, make a copy’ is a later loan usage].) The overall meaning of 緑 was originally ‘silk the color of verdigris’; later it was used for just the color itself. KJ1970:932,931; YK1976:499; MS1995:v2:1018-9,v1:474-5. We suggest taking 䩑 as a hand ヨ squeezing liquid/water (see 水 42 ‘water’).	HAND SQUEEZES GREEN DROPS IN THREAD-LIKE FASHION	images/Chapter3_img_305.jpg; images/Chapter3_img_306.jpg

列	RETSU	row, line	L3	437	6	列車 [RESSHA] - train; 列次 [RETSUJI] - sequence; 前列 [ZENRETSU] - front row	Seal . Has 刂 198 ‘knife, cut’, and an early form (see 302), interpreted as skeletal remains (possibly this depicted just the occipital bone, which forms back and base of skull and encircles top of spinal cord, to represent a complete skeleton); in later stages of the script this changed in shape through to become 歹 . The latter element serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘separate, cleave’. There was a set order to cutting up an animal into pieces, often arranged in a row, and so the meaning of this graph was extended to ‘row, line, order’.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 柬 (originally 束 561 ‘bundle of twigs/branches’, with 八 70 ‘divide; select’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘soften by boiling’, which referred to a process of bringing out the gloss in silk thread, and was also applied to the product, i.e. silk fabric woven with glossed thread. The meaning was then modified from ‘work/process silk thread’ to ‘attain skill in a task, practice’. KJ1970:648; MS1995:v1:658-9; YK1976:504-5; OT1968:784.

愛	AI	love	L3	441	13	愛情 [AIJŌ] - love; 母性愛 [BOSEIAI] - maternal love; 愛国者 [AIKOKUSHA] - patriot	Seal ; traditional ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. There are several complicating factors with the etymology of this graph, explained below. Analyzed by Yamada as 夊 in line with the seal form (‘walk slowly, drag feet’ [determinative 35; see Appendix]), with (an obsolete graph meaning ‘favor, feel compassion’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘by stealth’, to give overall meaning ‘walk stealthily’; Katō sees this tentatively as the possible meaning also. Both scholars regard ‘love’ as a loan usage. Mizukami notes an alternative analysis: 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ with 夂 ‘descending foot’ (determinative 34) and 旡 (originally, pictograph of person who has eaten till full) ‘be full; stick in the throat’; overall meaning is ‘difficult to move forward with heart full of anguish’, and ‘love’ as loan usage. Note this analysis has 夂 ‘descending foot’, but treats as meaning 夊 ‘walk slowly’. Morohashi quotes the voluminous 17 th century dictionary Zhengzitong in treating as the original way of writing 愛 . He makes no mention of loan usage for ‘love’, though it would appear to be valid to take ‘love’ as an extension of ‘favor, feel compassion’, the original meaning of .

案	AN	plan, concern, table	L3	442	10	提案 [TEIAN] - plan; 案外 [ANGAI] - unexpectedly; 案内 [ANNAI] - guidance	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 安 242 (‘relax’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘place, put’, to represent a small table on which tableware and food were put. Meanings such as ‘investigate’, ‘consider’, ‘plan’ are loan usages (Yamada). Art dating back to the Shang Dynasty shows that low tables were in use in China at that period already.

位	I, kurai	rank, extent	L3	445	7	地位 [CHII] - position, rank; 学位 [GAKUI] - academic degree; 位置 [ICHI] - situation, position	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Mizukami and Yamada say 位 and 立 77 ‘stand (/ up)’ were originally the same graph, but the situation would be better expressed as ‘originally (in Chinese) 立 represented two separate but related words’, one meaning ‘stand, stand up’, the other meaning ‘position or place (in a court or group of persons)’. For this latter meaning, the separate graph with 亻 41 ‘person’ added as left-hand component was devised at the seal stage. Yamada takes as 亻 ‘person’ with 立 , the latter functioning as both semantic and phonetic meaning ‘people lined up’, to give an overall meaning of ‘place where people stand’; Katō is in agreement.

Has 艹 53 ‘plant’, and 央 254 ‘center’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘blossom’, and by extension ‘beautiful, excellent’. The sense ‘Britain’ reflects the adoption by the Chinese of this graph for its sound value ( ying ) to represent the Chinese version of ‘England’, i.e. 英 国 Yingguo ). The choice of 英 seems to show a positive view of England/Britain at the time. YK1976:65; KJ1970:77; OT1968:846.	SUPERIOR PLANTS IN THE CENTER OF ENGLAND	images/Chapter4_img_19.jpg

塩	EN, shio	salt	L3	451	13	食塩 [SHOKUEN] - table salt; 塩水 [shiomizu] - saltwater; 製塩所 [SEIENSHO] - saltworks	Seal ; traditional 鹽 . Traditional form has 鹵 , based on pictograph of salt or salty soil contained in a basket-like container, and 監 1159 (‘watch’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bitter’ (Katō, Yamada); Schuessler, though, considers the proposed associated sense ‘bitter’ as unlikely here, on linguistic grounds. Ogawa, by contrast, takes the sense of the phonetic as ‘soak in water’, namely seawater. This is noted tentatively as a possibility by Mizukami also, who gives a bronze equivalent that includes 氵 42 ‘water’ as an additional component, though the ‘water’ component here could alternatively reflect part of a process for obtaining salt (‘rock salt’) from salty soil. Salt was an important trading commodity in ancient China, as in other ancient civilisations, due in part to its preserving qualities. The modern (block script) form has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, reflecting that one salt production method was from the ground. The right-hand side is a simplified modification in shape to the upper right and lower elements of the traditional form (examples of the simplified right-hand side can be found in Han time clerical script). KJ1970:105; YK1976:71; OT1968:1158; MS1995:v2:1502-3; AS2007:554; WM1974:121. Suggest taking four components: 土 64 ‘ground’, 41 ‘person’, 口 22 ‘mouth’, and 皿 300 ‘dish ‘.

億	OKU	100,000,000; lots	L3	452	15	二億 [NIOKU] - 200 million; 十億 [JŪOKU] - billion; 億兆 [OKUCHŌ] - ‘the masses’	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’ and 意 246 (‘thought’) as semantic and phonetic with associated meaning ‘heart is full, content’ (Ogawa), giving overall meaning ‘satisfied person’. The meaning ‘one hundred million/extremely large number’ (originally ‘one hundred thousand’) is loan usage. Based on the seal form Yamada feels that the standard script form of 億 should properly be (‘satisfied’), but Kangxi zidian quotes the 11th century Jiyun dictionary, which says that this latter graph and 億 are the same.

Seal script has what seems to be 田 63 ‘field’, but this is generally taken as fruit (Yamada says fruit with streaks), to give overall meaning ‘small fruit on a tree’. ‘Carry out’ and ‘result’ are extended meanings.

Has 貝 10 ‘shell/currency’, and 化 258 (‘change’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘change’, to give overall sense ‘currency changes into something different’ or ‘something exchanged with money’; and by extension, ‘treasure, wealth, assets’. This graph is seen on one category of very early inscribed items found in Japan (sites in Nagasaki Prefecture) – coins brought over from China dating back to the early 1 st century AD which in seal script read 貨泉 ‘coinage’ ( 泉 926 ‘spring’, here serves as loan for 銭 757 ‘copper coin, money’).

If Ogawa’s interpretation is followed, the division of work, which would involve allocation, and often a degree of sequencing, may be seen as having given rise to extended meanings such as ‘levy’, ‘section’, ‘lesson’.

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 戒 1095 (‘warn, admonish’ qv) functioning here either semantically to mean ‘admonish’, to give an overall meaning of ‘wooden item used to admonish’, i.e. handcuffs or shackles, or phonetically with an associated sense of ‘device, tool’, to give ‘wooden device/tool’. The latter sense may be regarded as a generalised meaning based on the former. KJ1970:147; YK1976:90; OT1968:506. Again we suggest two mnemonics, one using 戒 as it stands, with its meaning of ‘admonish,’ and one breaking it down to its component parts: 戈 545 ‘halberd’ with indicating two hands.

Has 行 131 ‘go/crossroads’, and NJK 圭 (originally piled up 土 64 ‘earth’ as boundary between fields, later ‘corner’) as phonetic with associated sense historically taken as ‘diverge’, but in modern times as ‘join’, to give ‘roads which join’.

Has 見 20 ‘look/see’ (originally ‘appear before the eyes’), and (join pieces of wood with the hands, presumably timbers on a roof [ 冖 / 宀 ]: see 11 and 30) as phonetic with associated sense ‘clear, evident’, to give ‘become clear before the eyes’, and extended senses such as ‘discern, understand’. KJ1970:195; YK1976:96; OT1968:915; MS1995:v2:1176-7. As with 学 11, we suggest taking the upper part as ‘ornate roof’.

Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 官 465 (‘house/building with minor official’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pierce, penetrate’ (Ogawa says ‘hole’), to give ‘pierced length of bamboo’, and so ‘bamboo wind instrument’; also used in generalized sense for ‘pipe’.

Yamada treats the sense ‘record, chronicle’ as loan usage, but alternatively it may be extended usage on the basis of the thread of continuity in an account or record. As Qiu notes – with reference to Chinese – there is some overlap in usage of 紀 and 記 115 ‘account, record’, and this may also be the case in Japanese.

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and NJK 竟 (‘end’, originally of a piece of music) as phonetic with associated sense ‘appearance, shape’. In early China, mirrors were typically thin discs made of bronze, with the back decorated – often ornately – with patterns and motifs of great significance (mythological, etc.), and often featured inscriptions also. Bronze was a material used extensively for ritual artefacts such as mirrors, affordable only to the wealthy. KJ1970:350-51; OT1968:1049; YK1976:135.

Has 木 73 ‘tree/wood’ and CO 亟 (‘urge on, hurry’) as phonetic, typically taken as having associated sense ‘in the highest place’, thus timber in the highest place in a building, i.e. ‘ridgebeam’; by extension, ‘extremity, limit’ (Katō, Ogawa, Yamada). Shirakawa, by contrast, believes the initial meaning of 極 was a form of capital punishment (later written 殛 ), and that ridgebeam is a later meaning.

Has 言 118 ‘words’, and 川 50 (‘river’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘follow’, to give ‘make to follow using words, instruct’. Also has the specific meaning ‘native Japanese reading for a Chinese character’, or ‘ kun reading’. The graph also retains its early meaning ‘instruct’, reflecting the fact that when Chinese script and language were brought to Japan, the Japanese were instructed in the meanings of Chinese characters.

Has 阝 376 (as abbreviated right-hand form of 邑 ‘settlement, village’), and 君 285 (‘lord’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘collect, accumulate’, to give ‘a collection of settlements’. This served as an administrative unit for such (of varying scale) from an early period in China, and then in Japan, where it is still used. KJ1970:343; YK1976:145; OT1968:1020.

Has 彳 131 ‘road, go’, and 巠 287 (thread stretched on a loom) as phonetic with associated sense ‘straight’ (Tōdō, Shirakawa, Ogawa). Thus ‘direct path’. However, Katō and Yamada take 巠 as ‘small’. This is just one of many examples of divergence in assessing the associated sense of a phonetic in the same graph – in this case, it seems to result from two different interpretations of the same explanation for 巠 in Zilin , a Chinese dictionary compiled ca. 300AD which has survived only in fragments.

Has 日 66 ‘sun’, and 京 110 (‘capital’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘light’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘demarcate’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). The latter sense derives from the clear boundary or line of demarcation between light and the shadow cast by an object; in Tōdō’s word-family ‘firm/clearly demarcate’, together with 境 680 ‘boundary’.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 吉 1196 (‘good fortune’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend’ (Katō, Yamada) or ‘fasten tightly’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Either interpretation gives ‘tie knot in thread/rope’, and then by extension the more generalized ‘join up’; ‘conclude, tie up’ is a further, figurative extension.

The associated meaning of 僉 here is disputed: one analysis takes it as phonetic with associated sense unclear (Katō, Yamada), regarding ‘examine’ as a loan usage. Tōdō, though, includes it in a word-family with associated sense ‘collect and bring together/under control’, an interpretation giving ‘examine’. KJ1970:376-7; YK1976:161; TA1965:842-6.

Has 囗 84 ‘enclosure’ (taken here as walls of a castle or citadel), and 古 121 (‘old’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘solid, hard, firm’, to give ‘defend solidly with castle walls’ or ‘defend castle walls solidly’. The meaning later became generalized to ‘hard, solid’; in Tōdō’s word-family ‘hard, solid’. KJ1970:392; YK1976:167; TA1965:385-90; OT1968:205.

Katō and Yamada treat as 亻 41 ‘person’, and 矦 (an NJK graph which they alone take as meaning ‘hunch-back’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘go/come out to greet’, and by extension ‘look out for’ (Katō, Yamada). Shirakawa also links 矦 to ‘target’, but regards it as referring to a purificatory ritual involving shooting arrows. Treatment by scholars reflects a degree of historical confusion between 候 and 侯 , two graphs similar in shape, pronunciation, and meaning. Uncertainty over the early history of the words and meanings represented by these two graphs is noted by Schuessler. As for the meaning ‘serve’ (primarily as an older meaning), Shirakawa observes on the basis of information in Yupian that in higher circles in early China there was a position designated as 候人 , a role which involved greeting visitors. The meanings ‘weather’ and ‘sign’ for 候 can be seen as extended senses deriving from ‘look out for’ relating to weather conditions. In ancient China the year was divided into the ‘seventy-two short periods’ ( 七十 二候 ), of five days each. Numerical categories such as this – other examples include the Five Elements ( 五行 ), the Eight [Musical] Sounds ( 八音 ), and the Ten Moral Obligations ( 十義 ) to name but a few – have been an integral part of Chinese culture from ancient times.

The top element 日 in the block script version of this graph – easily mistaken for 日 66 ‘sun, day’ – is just the result of historical shape regularization, a process which has often led, as here, to the etymology being obscured. KJ1970:501-2; YK1976:199; OT1968:157. We suggest taking 日 as ‘sun’ for convenience.	TAKE MOST SUN WHEN IT’S AT ITS HIGHEST	images/Chapter4_img_141.jpg

Later, it also acquired generalized meaning ‘useful material, resource’ in both physical and figurative senses. KJ1970:422; YK1976:201; TA1965:107-9. Suggest taking 才 for its meaning ‘age’.

Has 日 66 ‘day’, and 乍 141 (‘cut up wood; make’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate’, to give original sense ‘some days earlier’. The more restricted meaning ‘last, previous’ (in Japanese, effectively the only modern sense) dates back to at least the time of the Guangyun dictionary (1008 AD); in that work, 昨 is connected to 隔 1120 (‘separate’), but other proposed connections include 昔 346 ‘in the past; yesterday’ (Schuessler).

Has 木 73 ‘wood’, and 乙 1072 (‘knife tool for carving’), usually taken as phonetic only, with associated meaning ‘shave off, reduce’, but may also be regarded as semantic. Thus ‘thinly shaved piece of wood’, i.e. a wooden tag. In modern usage, has a range of meanings such as ‘receipt, coupon, [paper currency] note’. Tags or thin tablets made of wood were in common use in early Japan – when paper was an expensive writing medium – as labels attached to goods, for letters and other documents, and for writing practice. Though typically quite short, they are a valuable source of information regarding aspects of early Japanese history. KJ1970:439; OT1968:486.

刷	SATSU, su	print, rub	L3	514	8	印刷 [INSATSU] - printing; 刷新 [SASSHIN] - reform; 校正刷り [KŌSEIzuri] - printer’s proofs	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 刂 198 ‘knife/cut’, and (listed in Kangxi zidian as an old way of writing 豕 89 ‘wild boar, pig’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘scrape, shave off’, to give ‘scrape with knife’ (Katō, Yamada). Katō also links 刷 to 削 1385 ‘scrape, pare, cut’, while Schuessler considers it to be probably related to NJK 刮 ‘scrape’, which comprises 刂 198 ‘knife’, with 舌 755 (‘tongue’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘create space’, giving original meaning ‘scraping tool’. Tōdō and Ogawa, alternatively, take the associated sense as ‘rub’, which is the meaning of another graph of similar shape, i.e. , which has 又 2003 ‘hand’ as determinative and originally referred to wiping one’s bottom (Katō). It is generally considered that printing – on wooden blocks – was invented in China; the earliest surviving printed book dates from 868AD, though earlier shorter printed texts or images do exist. Rubbing was part of the process of printing texts on wooden blocks, but it was a lesser task: the more demanding main work involved the actual engraving, i.e. the cutting out of text and/or images on the blocks, in reverse; a sheet of paper was then applied to the surface of the inked block and rubbed to produce the text or image. The earliest printing technology dates from later than the emergence of seal script, so it would be wrong to connect the etymological origins of 刷 to considerations of printing. Nevertheless, use of the ‘knife’ determinative is supportive of interpretation of 刷 as ‘scrape’ rather than ‘rub, wipe’, as Katō points out. ZY2009:v1:254; KJ1970:439; YK1976:204; TA1965:572-3,624-9; OT1968:115; AS2007:474,264; KJ1985:69. Regarding a mnemonic we suggest taking 巾 as itself, namely 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, and the NJK 256 尸 , the so-called ‘corpse’determinative, which often refers to a slumped figure with buttocks stuck out, and occurs with a meaning of ‘buttocks’ in a number of characters, such as 尾 1888 ‘tail’.	‘BUTTOCK CLOTH’ HAS FINELY CUT PRINT	images/174a.jpg; images/174b.jpg

察	SATSU	judge, surmise, realise	L3	516	14	警察 [KEISATSU] - police; 察知 [SATCHI] - inference; 観察 [KANSATSU] - observation	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). There are diverse interpretations for this graph, and the etymology is uncertain. There is general agreement regarding 宀 30 ‘roof’ as ‘cover’, though Katō appears to believe that a cover is specifically being put on a roof. As for 祭 299 ‘worship; festival’ (originally meat [and in some cases wine] being placed on an offering table/altar), Katō and Yamada treat this as a phonetic component with an associated sense ‘place on top’, to give the overall meaning ‘cover’. Yamada regards the meanings ‘look carefully, examine’ as loan usage. Katō too is of the same opinion. Shirakawa, for his part, takes 祭 as having a semantic role, with its original meaning, to give the proposed overall meaning of ‘make offerings in a shrine’ – presumably under a roof. Tōdō, by contrast, proposes the associated sense ‘cleanse and examine’, on the basis of classical usage. KJ1970:426; YK1976:205; SS1984:349; KJ1985:172. As a mnemonic, we suggest taking 宀 as a roof, and 祭 as ‘worship’.	SURMISE WHY ONE WORSHIPS UNDER ROOF	images/Chapter4_img_148.jpg

It originally stood for the name of a river, as noted in Shuowen . Tōdō, however, includes 治 in a word-family ‘modify by human activity’, and gives a classical reference to show it was used at an early period meaning ‘modify (topography/landscape)’, and so by extension ‘regulate, govern’. Schuessler also notes early (but post-OBI) meanings which include ‘govern; punish; in good order’. KJ1970:15; YK1976:356; OT1968:566; TA1965:74-7; AS2007:619.

One analysis takes the graph as 手 34 ‘hand’, with 乙 1072 (knife tool for carving) as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘drop’, ‘lose’, to give ‘lose out of the hand’ (Katō, Yamada). This by extension came to mean ‘lose something in general’. Alternatively, the bottom right-hand element in the seal form has been taken as indicating movement sideways, but again with much the same overall meaning as the analysis noted above (Tōdō). KJ1970:486-7; YK1976:235; TA1965:754-6. We suggest taking the modern graph as 夫 601 ‘husband / man’ with the extra stroke taken as a baton.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with 昔 346 (‘past, accumulated days’). One analysis takes 昔 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘accumulate’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or alternatively as phonetic with associated sense ‘person who pretends/is a substitute’, then generalized to ‘substitute; something not one’s own’, and so something borrowed. In Chinese this graph can also mean ‘lend’. KJ1970:615; YK1976:241; OT1968:70; TA1965:364-7; AS2007:314.	A PERSON IN THE PAST HAD TO BORROW TO PAY RENT	images/Chapter4_img_183.jpg

Yamada sees ‘seed’ and ‘type, kind’ as loan usages, but Tōdō sees a semantic link between 重 ‘heavy’ and the heads of grain heavy with seed. KJ1970:704; YK1976:246; OT1968:736; TA1965:291.

Has 木 73 ‘tree’, and 公 126 (‘public; fair’) as phonetic with associated sense regarding which interpretations differ. Katō takes as ‘needle’, to give tree with needle-shape leaves, while Ogawa takes as ‘gather, come together’, to give tree with leaves close together; both scholars come to the same meaning, i.e. pine tree.

笑	SHŌ, wara	laugh, smile	L3	537	10	苦笑 [KUSHŌ] - wry smile; 笑い声 [waraigoe] - laughter; 笑顔 [egao] - smiling face	Seal ; a late graph which is included in Shuowen xinfu . This graph is the result of fluctuation in shape, or possibly error. According to Yamada, 笑 originated from a graph written 芺 , meaning ‘thistle’, which was borrowed as a loan writing for the abstract word meaning ‘laugh’; following this, as the result of miscopying, 芺 was written with 关 and then , and as a further variation the top element came to be written as 竹 / 58 ‘bamboo’. To disambiguate 芺 in the two senses of ‘thistle’ and ‘laugh’, 口 was added for the latter meaning, to give . As a further complicating twist, 口 22 (‘mouth’) was also added to 关 / above, to give 咲 1391 (note: 咲 is used in the sense ‘bloom’ only in Japanese; in Chinese it retains its original sense ‘laugh’). In broad terms, Ogawa adopts a broadly similar view, taking 芺 as being the result of miscopying, and borrowed as a loan for a word meaning ‘act coquettishly’; Katō treats the sense ‘act coquettishly’ as the original meaning of 笑 , and ‘laugh’ as a further extension of meaning. In the above there is reference to 竹 as a top element having been substituted for 艹 53 (‘grass, plant’); the explanation for this is that in the clerical script (the developmental stage before block script) these two elements were sometimes used interchangeably (as top elements), as noted by Qiu. YK1976:272; OT1968:748; KJ1970:85; QX2000:323. We suggest taking 夭 as a big man 大 56 with head bent.

Has 22 口 ‘mouth’ ‘speak’, and NJK 昌 (‘sun rises; rise’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘raise’, to give ‘raise the voice/pitch of the voice’, and by extension ‘sing’. The seal (and older) forms of 昌 point to only the upper component as being 日 66 ‘sun, day’, and the lower component as different: i.e. NJK 曰 ‘say, speak’ (determinative no. 73), with OBI and bronze forms representing breath coming out of the mouth when speaking.

Analysis of latter varies. One takes 堯 as associated sense ‘rise high’ (Katō, Yamada), giving ‘flames rise’. Ogawa sees it as associated sense ‘surround’ (later 繞 ), when setting wildfires in hunting. However, Tōdō feels phonetic role for 堯 unlikely based on historical pronunciation, and includes in his word-family ‘curve’, giving ‘flames curving upwards’. KJ1970:604-5; YK1976:275; OT1968:620; TA1965:245-6. We suggest taking as 十 [35] ‘ten’ x 3 and 一 [1] ‘one’ = 31 legs. See also 1230 暁 .		images/Chapter4_img_198.jpg; images/Chapter4_img_199.jpg

Consists of 目 76 ‘eye’, with a second element 少 160 (‘few’) which is taken either as phonetic in function or as semantic, depending on the scholar. The phonetic view (Katō, Yamada) takes 少 as having the associated sense ‘cover, conceal’, and links 省 to what in seal script is the similarly-shaped 眚 , which means ‘cannot see clearly’ (a CO; in modern Chinese usage has meanings ‘cataract’ and ‘disaster’). Katō and Yamada feel that confusion arose between 眚 and 省 due partly to the similarity of shape, but also because of similarity in pronunciation between 省 and 視 889 ‘see’, which led to ‘see’ being taken (misunderstood) as the main sense of 省 ( 省 is noted as ‘see’ in Shuowen ). Ogawa also considers that 少 came to be used sometimes in place of 生 44 (‘life’) in this graph through error arising from the similarity in shape of these elements (there is limited similarity in shape between the two in some bronze forms). Tōdō treats the 少 of 省 as having a semantic function, and includes the graph and underlying word in a word-family ‘divide up small’; on this basis, he takes 省 as ‘make the eyes narrow and look’; ‘examine’ may then be seen as an extended sense, along with ‘ministry’, for in ancient China one had to pass examinations to work for the government.. Both the semantic and the phonetic interpretations are listed by Mizukami. 眚 (but not 省 ) is regarded by various commentators as having OBI and bronze equivalents, though Mizukami lists and treats both these graphs as occurring at the OBI and bronze stages with the same or ‘shared’ shapes, with divergence first occurring at the seal stage. Yamada suggests this divergence in shape between the two arose due to an old or regional variant being adopted as the basis for 省. Whichever analysis is followed, the sense ‘omit’ may be regarded as a loan usage. KJ1970:598-9; YK1976:270-71; OT1968:697; MS1995:v2:916-18,920-21; TA1965:481-2.

Has 言 118 ‘words, speech’, and NJK / 兌 (shaman – one who invokes and disseminates to the gods the will of humans) as either semantic or phonetic. Yamada and Shirakawa take semantically as ‘shaman who invokes the gods’; Katō, however, sees here as phonetic with associated sense ‘set up, establish’. Resultant overall meaning of 説 based on the above is ‘disseminate/set out ideas through language’. YK1976:313; SS1984:513; KJ1970:602-3.

Has 辶 / 辶 85 ‘go, walk’, and 巽 (CO, ‘arrange items on table in order’) as phonetic with associated sense taken by Katō and Yamada as ‘continue afterwards’ &gt; ‘continue walking’. Ogawa, alternatively, treats 巽 as both semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘arrange properly’, to give original meaning ‘select, arrange, and send’ for 選 . With Ogawa’s treatment, ‘choose’ is a selectively extended sense, while Katō and Yamada take it as a loan usage. KJ1970:625; YK1976:320; OT1968:1014.

One view takes as 木 73 ‘tree’, with top element representing a bird’s nest (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Seal form suggests this, but the one bronze form scholars list has an ordered appearance, suggesting an artificial object. Katō treats top element as pictograph of container – in this case wine strainer or press – but here acting as phonetic (corresponding to later 甾 ) and having associated sense ‘gather, collect’, to give ‘birds gather and settle on a tree’. As things are collected in a container, the top element may be taken as both semantic and phonetic if Katō is followed. OT1968:508; SS1984:542; KJ1970:432.

卒	SOTSU	soldier, end, die, sudden	L3	564	8	卒業 [SOTSUGYŌ] - graduation; 兵卒 [HEISOTSU] - soldier; 卒去 [SOKKYO] - death	Seal . Seal has 衣 444 ‘garment’, with a mark 丿. Typically the mark is taken as showing a way of making the garment distinctive for use by a particular group, namely slaves or low-ranking servants, possibly by using dyes; the garment may have been a lightweight one to wear on top. In this view, overall meaning of 卒 is ‘dyed garment’ (Katō, Yamada), and senses such as ‘sudden’ and ‘die’ are loan usages. In contrast, Shirakawa attributes a ritualistic significance, considering ‘die’ to be the main meaning of this graph, based on it originally showing an upper garment for a dead person, with the element 丿 showing a cord for tying; a similar type of garment was later worn also by low-ranking servants and soldiers. In Shirakawa’s treatment, the sense ‘sudden’ appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:651-2; YK1976:338; OT1968:139; MS1995:v1:168-9; SS1984:556.

Former view (Katō, Yamada) gives ‘those who live lower down, servants’, as opposed to the nobility; adherents of the other view (Ogawa, Tōdō) take 低 to mean ‘short person’. In both cases, ‘short, low’ is an extended sense generalized from original meaning. Mizukami lists both views for the element 氐 . KJ1970:713-4; YK1976:372; TA1965:749-52; OT1968:55; MS1995:v2:724-6.

Has 广 127 ‘house, building’, and 氐 (either ‘base of small hill’, or ‘spoon touching bottom of plate’ &gt; ‘down low’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘dwelling at foot of hill’ (see 575). Yamada takes ‘lowest part, bottom’ as loan usage, but it can alternatively be seen as extended sense through generalization. Ogawa takes 氐 differently, as phonetic only with associated sense ‘stop, stay’; in this view, ‘bottom’ is loan use. KJ1970:713; YK1976:373; OT1968:327-8. As 575, use ‘clan’ 氏 and ‘bottom line’.

Seal form has 日 66 ‘sun’, and 勺 (‘ladle; traditional unit of measure’, in Jōyō kanji List 1981, excluded 2010) as phonetic with associated sense ‘white, bright’, to give ‘bright sunlight’. Block script has this graph with 白 69 ‘white’, not 日 , and 的 is treated in Kangxi zidian as a later variant form of 旳 ; the meaning range ‘white, bright’ for 白 may have led to this change between seal and block script. Katō and Yamada suggest the meaning ‘target’ derives from targets having been white. Meanings such as ‘-like’ (to form adjectives) and – in Chinese – for other grammatical elements represent loan usage. KJ1970:720; YK1976:375; OT1968:687; AS2007:631.

Has 土 64 ‘ground’, and 尚 1491 (smoke rising from high-up window, now meaning ‘moreover’, ‘esteem’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘high, tall’. Originally, thought to have normally denoted a site with earth piled up high with a building set on top; appears to have come to denote a very substantial building.

The phonetic is taken as associated sense ‘single young male’, to give ‘bull’ (Katō, Yamada), or alternatively ‘stand upright’, to give ‘stud bull’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Bulls were often taken for sacrificial purposes, and the ones selected tended to be of the highest quality, hence the sense ‘special’; Shirakawa also quotes an early passage in which 特 has the meaning ‘special’, this time with reference to people.

Has 火 / 灬 8 ‘flames, fire’, and (later 埶 ) (‘kneel on the ground and plant tree’: see 495). The latter element is taken in one analysis as phonetic with associated sense ‘rising heat from fermenting wine’, later generalized in meaning to ‘hot vapor/hot’ and combining with 火 / 灬 to give ‘heat; burn’. Another interpretation takes 埶 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘power, energy’, regarding it as the original way of writing 勢 747 ‘power’, giving ‘heat to burn things’ (Ogawa). KJ1970:354-5; YK1976:402-3; OT1968:626. We suggest taking top left element as ‘mounds of earth’ (see 627), and 丸 101 as ‘circle/round’.

As the seal form shows, originally has 火 8 ‘flames, fire’, and upper element as phonetic with associated sense ‘fly, fly up’, to give ‘sparks fly up’. Shirakawa agrees with latter meaning, but links graph to the ritual burning of a corpse (cremation). Tōdō includes 票 – together with 標 599 – in his word-family ‘rise lightly’. The modern senses ‘vote’, ‘sign’, ‘ticket’ seem to be loan usages. KJ1970:845-6; YK1976:428; OT1968:723; SS1984:725-6; TA1965:275-7. Take as 西 169 ‘west’ plus 示 723 ‘show’.

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 票 598 qv as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘topmost tree branches; twigs’, to give ‘slender treetop branches, tips of treetops’ (Katō, Yamada, Ogawa). Yamada takes ‘sign, mark’ as a loan usage, but Tōdō treats as an extended use, meaning a signboard placed high up, as does Shirakawa. KJ1970:846-7; YK1976:428-9; OT1968:524; TA1965:275-7; SS1984:727.

Later, this took on the more restricted sense of a building to store documents and the like, and so ‘government office’. By further extension, came to mean an administrative area under government control such as an urban prefecture or the seat of government. KJ1970:823; MS1995:v1:452-3; YK1976:432-3; OT1968:328.

Has 刂 198 ‘knife’, and 畐 (CO, ‘wide-necked jar’, see 409) as phonetic with associated sense ‘open up’, to give ‘open up with a knife’, such as sacrificial animal. ‘Divide in two’ evolved as an extended sense, and by Han times one of the two divided parts, referred to as 副 , had acquired the meaning ‘secondary’, hence sense range ‘deputy, vice-, sub’. Mizukami lists one OBI form that he equates with 副. MS1995:v1:134-5; KJ1970:828; YK1976:437. Suggest take as 一 1 ‘single’, 口 22 ‘entrance’, and 田 63 ‘field’.

別	BETSU, waka	diverge, split, differ, special	L4	607	7	別名 [BETSUMEI] - alias; 特別 [TOKUBETSU] - special; 別れ [wakare] - parting	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 刂 198 ‘knife’, with 冎 . The latter element is interpreted variously as ‘skull, cranium’ (Yamada), or as a pictograph of where the base of the skull and the top vertebra meet (occipital bone) (Mizukami), or as ‘bone (in general)’ (Ogawa), to give ‘separate meat from skull/bone with a knife’, with this leading to the extended general meaning of ‘separate’. It was also used in early Chinese for a near-homophone meaning ‘to be different’, and thus ‘special’ may be regarded as a loan usage. The left-hand side of 別 , which is noticeably different in shape in block script from the seal form of 冎 , appears to result from cursivized equivalents found in the clerical script. Mizukami lists one OBI form which he treats as 別. KJ1970:848; YK1976:445; OT1968:114; MS1995:v1:108-9, 130-31; AS2007:167; SK1984:94. This is a difficult graph in terms of mnemonics, but we suggest taking the left part as an 口 22 ‘opening’ with as ‘special’ variant of 力 78 ‘strength’.

Has 攵 ( 攴 ) 112 ‘strike’, and (CO, original meaning: ‘thread becomes tangled’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘knock over and turn into something different’. Subsequently the sense ‘strike/knock over’ was omitted, to give the generalized meaning ‘change’. ‘Strange’ may be seen as an extended sense. Mizukami lists a few bronze forms which he takes as equivalents of 變 . In the modern abbreviated shape 変 , bottom element is 攵 in a variant 3-stroke shape (which is not 夂 ‘descending foot’: det. 34). KJ1970:898; YK1976:446-7; MS1995:v2:1214-5; OT1968:444. Suggest taking upper part as variant of 赤 48 ‘red’ (i.e. sort of red) and, though incorrect etymologically, 夂 as cross-legs.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 更 1323 (‘change’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘servant; use a servant’, and by extension ‘convenient, comfortable; service, mail’. The meaning ‘bodily waste’ appears to be a further euphemistic extension (cf. British English ‘public convenience’ in the sense ‘public toilet or restroom’). OT1968:66; YK1976:448-9.

Scholarly opinion is divided over whether OBI forms for this graph exist, and whether there were originally separate graphs for 末 and the similarly-shaped 未 617 (qv, originally, ‘tree with luxuriant growth’). There is general agreement that the graph 末 shows branches growing out from a tree (though Tōdō takes it to signify small branches at the top of a tree and equivalent originally to 未 ), but while Mizukami and Ma do not recognize any OBI forms, Katō and Yamada list what they take to be OBI forms for 末 , and consider that originally, at least, there was no difference in shape between 末 and 未 . The upper horizontal stroke of 末 is taken to focus attention on the top part of the tree, signifying ‘tip, end’ in a physical sense and by extension the abstract sense also, i.e. ‘end; last, final’. MS1995:v1:644-5; KJ1970:868; YK1976:462-3; QX2000:183; AS2007:389; TA1965:667-70.	TIP OF TREE HAS BIG END	images/Chapter4_img_338.jpg

The first seal form has 血 288 ‘blood’, and meaning ‘tributary’ (see also 派 965) as semantic and phonetic; the second has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, with . Both forms give the meaning ‘vein’, but the second came to predominate, probably because it was the one given in Shuowen , and is the main form given for this graph in the authoritative Kangxi zidian , which lists a third form, 脉 ( 月 ‘flesh, meat’, with 永 644 ‘long’), as a variant of 脈 . Extended usage is seen, for instance in ‘coal vein’, and in the sense ‘pulse’. KJ1970:751; YK1976:465; OT1968:822. We suggest taking as a variant of 川 50 ‘river, flow’, but with the specific meaning of ‘tributary’, and 月 as ‘flesh’.

Originally, in OBI and some bronze forms, this graph had the same shape as what later became 舞 1920 (person with long decorative sleeves, shown with feet pointed away from each other; ‘dance’). Taken to depict a person dancing with what appear to be long decorative sleeves, or what Qiu identifies as oxtails or similar hanging down. While Qiu’s suggestion might seem bizarre initially, he does note a passage in the Spring and Autumn Annals (compiled ca. 239BC) which describes dancing while holding oxtails. This graph, which originally had the sense ‘dancing’, was borrowed to conveniently represent another word of similar pronunciation meaning ‘not have’. In some bronze forms (and consistently later), we find 舛 (feet pointing different ways 336) added to further clarify the sense ‘dance’, while a different element (corresponding to modern 亡 985, now meaning ‘die’ or disappear’ but originally showing someone hiding in a corner and meaning: ‘cannot be seen’) was added to the predecessor of 無 at the seal stage. Shapes close to 無 itself, which is somewhat simpler than the seal equivalent, were already well-established in the clerical script. QX2000:186-7; YK1976:466-7; OT1968:621; AS2007:518; SK1984:467-8. We suggest taking the lower part as 灬 8 ‘fire’ and the upper part as a bound wheat-sheaf.	BOUND WHEATSHEAF BURNED, NOW ALL GONE	images/Chapter4_img_348.jpg; images/Chapter4_img_349.jpg
約	YAKU	promise, approx., summarise	L3	621	9	約束 [YAKUSOKU] - promise; 節約 [SETSUYAKU] - economize; 約十人 [YAKUJŪNIN] - ca. 10 people	Seal . This graph has 糸 29 ‘thread, cord’, and 勺 . The latter was formerly in the Jōyō kanji List, but was one of the five characters to be withdrawn from it in the changes in 2010. It originally depicted wine or soup being ladled into a container such as a half-gourd, but here it acts as a phonetic with associated meaning ‘bind, fasten’, to give ‘fasten tightly with cord (in some cases leaving noticeable marks)’. By extension, it acquired meanings such as ‘reduce, contract, bring together’, and then abstract meanings such as ‘make agreement’ and ‘summarise’. (One notes the similar use of the figurative concept/term ‘binding’ in English with regard to agreements and promises.) The latter sense of ‘summarise’ involves removal of non-essential points or items, thereby perhaps generating the meaning ‘approximately’. Early (post-OBI) senses listed by Schuessler include ‘abbreviate, condense, essential’. OT1968:768; MS1995:v2:1004,v1:146-7; KJ1970:874; YK1976:475.

Some bronze forms (as here) have 女 37 ‘woman’ as lower element; analyses of upper part differ. Seal form is taken as backbone with hipbones on either side (Katō, Yamada), or as two hands enclosing waist (Ogawa), or as hipbones and pelvis (Shirakawa), or yet again as 襾 (‘stopper, plug’) (not 西 169 ‘west’), as abbreviated form of 票 598 (‘sign’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘light’ or ‘tighten’ (Mizukami). Lower part of seal form has not 女 but a shape to represent two legs. Despite varied analysis, consensus is that the graph’s meaning is ‘waist’ (later written 腰 2054); by extension, ‘tie a waistband’ or ‘central part’, hence ‘pivotal, vital’. KJ1970:87; YK1976:483; OT1968:912; SS1984:847; MS1995:v2:1174-5. To simplify, we suggest as west(ern), and lower part as woman.

Both analyses refer to spokes of a cart/chariot wheel, extended to wheel itself. KJ1970:911-12; YK1976:500; OT1968:986; TA1965:686-9. We suggest 侖 as ‘capped’ ‘wheels’ 冊 .

Usually taken as 犬 19 ‘dog’, with 卥 (CO, originally, ‘foolish head’; by extension ‘difficult to distinguish’, then ‘similar, look alike’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘raccoon’, to give original meaning ‘raccoon-like creature’ (Katō, Yamada). The senses ‘similar; variety, sort’ are loan usages. Shirakawa, by contrast, seeks to give a ritualistic interpretation to the origin of the graph 類 , arguing that rice ( 米 220) and dogs ( 犬 ) were offered to the gods.

Has ice 冫 401, and 令 633 (‘rule’) as phonetic, but associated sense disputed. 令 is taken either as i] ‘shiver’ (Katō, Yamada), or as ii] ‘clear’ (Ogawa, Tōdō); i] gives ‘coldness of ice to make a person shiver’, while ii] gives ‘clear/bright cold’ or ‘ice which is clear/transparent’.

例	REI, tato	example, liken, precedent	L3	635	8	例外 [REIGAI] - exception; 前例 [ZENREI] - precedent; 例えば [tatoeba] - for example	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 列 437 (‘line’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘lined up’, to give ‘people lined up’. Lining up involves a degree of organization and arrangement, and this appears to have given rise to extended senses such as ‘usage/precedent’ and ‘example/likening’.

OBI has 止 143 ‘footprint’ (Mizukami and Ogawa take as ‘walk’), and 秝 (CO, orig two grain stalks) giving ‘place (seedlings) at set intervals’. Seal form also has 止 , but with 厤 (a CO, 厂 abbrev. of 石 47 ‘stone’, with 秝 as phonetic with sense ‘grind, polish’, giving ‘grind with whetstone’, or ‘polish and put in order’) as phonetic, again meaning ‘lined up at intervals’. Overall meaning is ‘walk/move at set intervals’, esp. of heavenly bodies (for movement of sun, a separate graph 曆 [2112 ‘calendar’] was devised at seal stage). By the Western Zhou period (11 th century – 771 BC) the graph 歷 was used to mean ‘series’; extending to ‘history; path’. Suggest 厂 as cliff, 止 in usual meaning of ‘stop’, and 林 as ‘forest’ 79.

連	REN, tsu	accompany, row	L3	637	10	連絡船 [RENRAKUSEN] - ferry; 連中 [RENJŪ] - party, group; 連れ合い [tsureai] - partner, companion	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. One is 車 33 ‘vehicle’, and 辶 85 ‘go’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘vehicle moves (slowly)’ (Katō, Yamada); this may refer to multiple vehicles together. However, Ogawa takes 辶 with 車 as abbrev of 輦 (CO) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘men pull a vehicle’. Tōdō includes 連 in his word-family ‘be linked up’, and sees it as denoting vehicles moving together. ‘Be linked together (in a row)’ is an extended meaning.

労	RŌ	labor, toil	L3	639	7	労働者 [RŌDŌSHA] - laborer; 苦労 [KURŌ] - hardship; 過労 [KARŌ] - overwork	Seal ; traditional 勞 . Perhaps most convincingly taken as 力 78 ‘strength, effort’ and as an abbreviation of 螢 (NJK, ‘firefly’) with semantic and phonetic function, meaning ‘small flame’, to give ‘work by the light of small flames’, i.e. ‘night work’ (Katō, Yamada), this then being extended to ‘work’ in general. Shirakawa, alternatively, looks to a ritualistic interpretation, linking it to sacred flames used to purify agricultural implements at the beginning and end of the season. Mizukami lists a number of bronze forms which he equates to 労 . KJ1970:81; YK1976:506; SS1984:913; MS1995:v1:142-3. As a mnemonic we suggest taking the three short strokes on top of roof 冖 as an ornate roof (see also 学 11), and 力 as ‘effort’.

録	ROKU	record, inscribe	L3	640	16	記録 [KIROKU] - record; 実録 [JITSUROKU] - true record; 録音 [ROKUON] - sound recording	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 錄 . Has 金 16 ‘metal’ (in ancient China, typically referred to bronze or copper), and 彔 (CO, originally a pictograph showing liquid [probably wine] being strained and dripping down) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘ooze, soak through’; overall meaning is that which exudes from copper, i.e. ‘verdigris’ (Katō, Yamada). Ogawa takes 彔 as phonetic with associated sense ‘shine’, to give ‘shine with a metal color’. Either way, the sense ‘record’ is just a loan usage, but the verdigris interpretation is more compelling (see 緑 435 ‘green’ also). KJ1970:931-2; YK1976:507; OT1968:1046. As a mnemonic we suggest associating this graph with ‘green’, as they have the same right hand part in the modern form.	RECORD BY INSCRIBING ON GREEN METAL	images/Chapter4_img_388.jpg
圧	ATSU	pressure	L3	641	5	圧力 [ATSURYOKU] - pressure; 電圧 [DEN’ATSU] - voltage; 圧倒的 [ATTŌTEKI] - overwhelming	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 壓 . The graph comprises 土 64 ‘earth, soil’, and 厭 (CO, analyzed as ‘cover’, ‘oppress’, ‘press’, or ‘sated with oppressive feeling [from overeating]’, ‘weary’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘press down’, to give ‘press down and cover with earth’; later this became more generalized in meaning as ‘press down, pressure’. The element 土 was added at the seal stage to create this graph so as to differentiate clearly the meaning ‘press down’ from other meanings of 厭 . KJ1970:105; YK1976:50; OT1968:210; MS1995:v1:186-9, v2:840-41; TA1965:853-9; AS2007:550; QX2000:267. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 厂 as a cliff.

移	I,	transfer, move	L3	642	11	移動 [IDŌ] - movement; 移民 [IMIN] - migrants; 移り気 [utsurigi] - fickle	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). The graph comprises 禾 87 ‘grain’, and 多 180 (‘many, numerous’) as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘sway (in the breeze)’, to give the original meaning ‘grain plants swaying in the breeze’. Commentators generally regard ‘move’ as a loan usage, but the original sense of 移 already involves some degree of movement. On the basis of the early Chinese sound values, it seems likely that 多 is serving here as an abbreviation for 迻 (CO, ‘walk with a swaying motion’). ‘Transfer’ is an extended meaning. KJ1970:17-18; YK1976:55; OT1968:733; MS1995:v2:1286; AS2007:566.	TRANSFER MANY RICE PLANTS	images/Chapter5_img_1.jpg

営	EI,	conduct,	L3	645	12	経営 [KEIEI] - management; 営業 [EIGYŌ] - business; 営所 [EISHO] - barracks	Seal ; traditional 營 . Analyses differ in relatively minor ways. One element is 呂 , in outward form corresponding to a NJK graph meaning ‘spine’ (in which two individual vertebrae are depicted, with the linking stroke first added only at the seal stage), but regarded as having a different sense here, i.e. ‘complex of linked buildings (or possibly rooms), palace’. This combines with the disputed upper element . Katō takes as the old form of 螢 (‘firefly’; modern 蛍 1263), here serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘surround’, to give ‘complex of buildings surrounded by fence/walls’. Yamada and Ogawa agree with this interpretation. Mizukami lists several alternative interpretations of what represents here, but still with the sense ‘surround’. ‘Barracks’ may be regarded as an extended sense. ‘Perform, conduct’ is treated as loan usage by Yamada; Schuessler notes ‘lay out, plan, build’ as early meanings. KJ1970:82, 79-80; YK1976:66; OT1968:187; MS1995:v2:812-3,v1:222; AS2007:576. As a mnemonic we suggest taking the upper element as an ornate roof (see also 学 11), and taking the linked squares as rooms within a bigger building. Alternatively, given the phonetic use of 呂 in the term 風呂 furo (bath) and consequent associations, a mnemonic could be based on the furo.

Has 木 73 ‘tree’, and element 嬰 (sense and function disputed). Mizukami and Katō analyze 嬰 as 女 37 ‘woman’, with 賏 (CO, ‘necklace’, from 貝 10 ‘shell’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘small, young’ (Mizukami takes ‘surround, add’ as loan usages), to give ‘baby girl’. Ogawa takes 嬰 as 女 with 賏 as both phonetic and semantic, giving ‘woman wearing necklace’, and by extension ‘surround’ (here ‘neck’), seeing ‘baby’ as loan usage. Both analyses have associated meaning ‘small’, significance being that in ancient China both peach and cherry were prized as fruits, and there are early references (noted by Katō) to cherry fruit being called ‘small peach’. Note: the graph 桜 and word sakura normally refer to flowering rather than fruiting cherry. KJ1970:83,3; MS1995:v1:346-7; OT1968:264,502; SS1984:65. Take top right as three petals.

Bronze form consists of i] two hands, with ii] an additional element 厂 (usually taken as ‘cliff’ or ‘cave dwelling’) with two short horizontal strokes or dots inside. There is some divergence in analysis. One element is often taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘false, deception; substitute’, to give the overall sense ‘wear a mask’ (Katō, Mizukami, Yamada, Ogawa). The basis for the inclusion of ‘mask’ here may not seem clear, but both Shirakawa and Tōdō also support this. Tōdō includes 叚 (and 假 ) in a word-family meaning ‘cover something underneath’, an interpretation which gives credible support for the sense ‘wear a mask’. Abstract meanings such as ‘imitation, provisional, temporary’ may be seen as extended senses. The element 亻 41 ‘person’ was added at the seal stage, with no significant change of meaning. The substitution of 反 for 叚 to create 仮 can be traced back to Han period cursivized clerical script forms. KJ1970:120; MS1995:v1:182-4,198-201; YK1976:79; OT1968:48; SS1984:71; TA1965:381-3; SK1984:62-3. We suggest taking 反 as the same-shaped 反 393 ‘oppose’.

価	KA,	price,	L3	657	8	価値 [KACHI] - value; 価格 [KAKAKU] - price; 物価 [BUKKA] - price of goods	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 價 . The graph has 亻 41 ‘person’ and 賈 (NJK, itself comprising 襾 ‘stopper, cover’, and 貝 10 ‘shell currency, valuables’, meaning ‘store goods, trade’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘business of buying and selling’, to give ‘someone who buys and sells, merchant’. By extension, the graph acquired related or extended other meanings such as ‘price, worth’. KJ1970:116; YK1976:80; OT1968:58,911,957; SS1984:72.

Has 辶 85 ‘walk, go’, and 咼 (originally, either ‘distorted mouth shape’ [Katō] or ‘smooth-moving body joints’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘many, much’, to give ‘go a long way/too far’ (Mizukami takes as ‘much latitude/margin’, to give ‘walk to a destination along an easy road’). OBI forms are listed by Mizukami, all of slightly different structure. KJ1970:312; YK1976:83; MS1995:v2:1298-1300; OT1968:1005.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind’, and 夬 (CO [see 289], possibly originally archer’s hand pulling bowstring, thus opening up front of body, and so ‘open’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘open’, thus ‘one’s heart opens’, and ‘be pleased, pleasant’. KJ1970:367; YK1976:88; OT1968:360. Suggest taking 夬 as man with back-pack.	BACK-PACKER’S HEART IS ALWAYS PLEASANT AND CHEERFUL	images/Chapter5_img_35.jpg
解	KAI,	unravel,	L3	662	13	解説 [KAISETSU] - commentary; 理解 [RIKAI] - understanding; 分解 [BUNKAI] - dismantling	OBI ; seal . OBI has 牛 108 ‘ox, cow’, and element showing two hands round a third element – the pictographic stage of 角 97 ‘horn’. This is commonly taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘divide up, split’, giving ‘divide up an ox/cow’, then more generally ‘divide, take apart’. Ma, alternatively, takes 角 as semantic. It may be both semantic and phonetic. Seal form has different composition, with 刀 198 ‘knife’, to give ‘cut up’; already used in generalized sense at an early period, not necessarily ‘cut up an ox’. Schuessler treats ‘understand’ as a separate word related to that for ‘divide up’, rather than an extended sense. MS1995:v2:1182-3; MR2007:306; KJ1970:150; YK1976:92.

Has 石 47 ‘stone’, and 隺 (CO ‘fly high; high’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hard’, to give ‘hard stone’, later just ‘hard’ (Katō, Yamada, Ogawa). Shirakawa explains link between ‘fly high’ and ‘hard’ by 隺 showing a bird ( 隹 324) trying to fly higher but firmly confined, representing something ‘hard’. Tōdō sees the bird as a crane, the NJK graph for which is 鶴 ( 隺 , with 鳥 190 ‘bird’). SS1984:105,108; KJ1970:195-6; YK1976:97; OT1968:714; TA1965:265. Suggest as ‘strange’ roof.

額	GAKU,	sum,	L3	665	18	金額 [KINGAKU] - sum of money; 額面 [GAKUMEN] - face value; 額際 [hitaigiwa] - hairline	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 客 270 (‘visitor’) or alternatively 各 (‘each’ 462) – both having similar pronunciation at that time – as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘shave off the head hair’, to indicate that part of the face framed by the borders of the hair when shaved, i.e. ‘forehead’ (Katō, Yamada). Normally one would not associate shaving with the forehead, but in ancient China (and in various periods in Japanese history also), the hairline was shaved so as to move hair further up the forehead, and /or trimming it at the sides, leaving a ‘desirable/fashionable’ framing of the forehead. Alternatively there is an interpretation of the phonetic element as having an associated sense of ‘wide, broad’, to denote the broad part of the face, again giving the meaning ‘forehead’ (Ogawa). ‘Frame’ is an extended sense related to the borders of the hairline, and ‘plaque’ may represent a further extension, whereas ‘amount /sum’ appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:192; YK1976:98; OT1968:1106; AS2007:253,334.	EACH VISITOR’S FOREHEAD LOOKS LIKE A FRAMED PLAQUE	images/Chapter5_img_42.jpg
刊	KAN	publish,	L3	666	5	刊行 [KANKŌ] - publication; 日刊 [NIKKAN] - daily issue; 発刊 [HAKKAN] - book launch	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 刂 ( 刀 ) 198 ‘knife, blade, cut, sword’, and 干 840 as phonetic with an associated sense of ‘dig out, carve out’ (Katō, Yamada), or ‘cut and make level’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). (Originally, 干 depicted a forked thrusting weapon with a hand-guard; but owing to its convenient simplicity it has over the centuries been borrowed extensively. Its modern meaning is ‘dry’.) The process of engraving woodblocks to produce texts and illustrated material on a large scale that was developed during the first millennium AD in China subsequently led to the meaning ‘print, publish’. YK1976:100; KJ1970:204; TA1965:601-06; OT1968:111; AS2007:331. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 干 in its current meaning of ‘dry’, with 刂 as ‘sword’.

幹	KAN,	trunk,	L1	667	13	幹線 [KANSEN] - trunk line; 幹部 [KANBU] - leaders; 幹事 [KANJI] - manager	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations differ somewhat. The original form in Shuowen is 榦 , where the meaning is given as wooden posts standing firmly in the ground at each end when building a fence; the graph comprises 木 73 ‘tree’, with the element 倝 (disputed sense as phonetic here) in the variant form , which shows 人 41 ‘person’, in one of its modified shapes as 人 . 倝 (or the variant), which is often taken as originally meaning ‘sun rising up’ (Mizukami, Katō, Yamada), is taken by Katō and Yamada as a phonetic with associated sense ‘base, stem’, to give ‘trunk/stem (rising up)’; Shirakawa, by contrast, interprets as a flagpole topped with a good luck symbol and banner (Ogawa also says ‘flagpole’), and follows the Shuowen view in regarding two such flagpoles being used for fence-building. Qiu considers that the element 倝 in its variant form was poorly recognized as a phonetic, a point which no doubt led to substitution of 干 (modern meaning ‘dry’: see 840) as phonetic instead, creating 幹 originally as a popular variant of 榦 . Either interpretation of 倝 still leads to the basic sense ‘rising high’, which together with 木 gives ‘tree/pole rising high’, and hence ‘trunk, main part’.

慣	KAN,	become	L3	668	14	習慣 [SHŪKAN] - habit, custom; 慣例 [KANREI] - convention; 世慣れた [yonareta] - worldly-wise	Seal form A ( 遦 ) ; seal form B ( 摜 ) ; 慣 itself is a late variant. 遦 (CO; has 辶 ’walk along road, go’ 85) and 摜 (CO; has 扌 ‘hand’ 34) are both defined in Shuowen as ‘familiar with’ or ‘custom’. In both graphs, the element 貫 (‘pierce’ 1148) is phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate’. For 遦 , Katō suggests original meaning ‘conduct by accumulating (actions)’, and for 摜 ‘become proficient using hands’. For 慣 , listed in Yupian (6th century), Yamada suggests taking as ‘become proficient by accumulating in the mind’. Not clear, though, whether these graph variations reflected actual meaning differences. KJ1970:337; YK1976:105; TA1965:640-42; DJ2009:v1:142,v3:986; AS2007:266.

眼	GAN,	eye	L1	669	11	双眼鏡 [SŌGANKYŌ] - binoculars; 肉眼 [NIKUGAN] - naked eye; 血眼 [chimanako] - bloodshot eyes	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. Most scholars take 目 76 ‘eye’, and 艮 281 (NJK ‘stop’, originally ‘hostility’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘round’, to give ‘eyeball’, and also ‘eye’ (Katō, Yamada); this view is supported by Schuessler, who sees the graph 眼 as representing an early Chinese (Late Han) word for ‘knob, bulge’, and a related near-homophone of that for ‘eyeball, eye’. Ogawa has a different view, taking 艮 as having associated sense ‘division’, to mean ‘eye cavity’ – presumably ‘eye socket’. Despite divergence in analysis, all scholars take 眼 as coming to mean ‘eye’ as a general term, like 目 76, though the two graphs are differentiated in modern written Japanese (and Chinese).

Has 宀 30 ‘roof, dwelling’, and 奇 1174 (originally person standing on one leg; now ‘strange’) either as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘stand on one leg’ (Yamada), or as phonetic with associated sense ‘rely on’ (Katō, Ogawa). In either case, the overall meaning is taken to be ‘stay temporarily at someone else’s house’. In Tōdō’s word-family indicating ‘bent’ (‘be bent at ninety degrees’).

Has 夫 601 ‘husband, man’, here not in its modern sense but instead representing another word – homophonous in early Chinese with that for ‘husband, man’ – in the measure sense ‘width of four fingers’, later written with the ‘hand’ determinative 扌 34 as 扶 (another meaning is ‘support, assist’, which is the one that has been retained through into modern Japanese: see 扶 1905). 夫 combines with 見 20 (‘see’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘round’, to give ‘a round measure’, i.e. ‘compass’. ‘Standard’ is an extended sense.

Gu, however, takes it as person with bundle of traditional Chinese herbs placed behind, for moxibustion; in this view, ‘long time’ is a loan use. KJ1970:258; YK1976:122; OT1968:24; GY2008:37.

Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 竟 (NJK, originally, ‘music piece ends’, now just ‘end, finish’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘boundary’, to give ‘boundary of land’. Katō links 竟 (and by extension, 境 ) to NJK 彊 , an older, more intricate graph (representing a near-homophone originally meaning ‘strong bow’ and then just ‘strong’) which was itself loaned for ‘boundary’, a sense subsequently reflected in the modified CO graph 疆 , which has 土 added).

Taken either as phonetic with associated sense ‘keep back, restrain’, giving ‘the gods restrain’ (Katō, Yamada), and by extension ‘forbid’, or as semantic, giving ‘sacred area surrounded by forest’ (Tōdō, Shirakawa, Ogawa), again giving ‘forbid’ by extension.

The element 牛 108 ‘ox, cow’ is taken to be an abbreviation for 牽 (NJK, originally ‘lead cow by a rope’; by extension, ‘be pulled/bound’), with 亻 41 ‘person’, to give overall meaning ‘person who is bound and not free’, i.e. ‘slave’. In ancient China, slaves were regarded as no more than objects, and hence extended senses such as ‘thing’. KJ1970:385-6; YK1976:156; MS1995:v2:834-5.

Has 阝 1907 ‘hill, mound’, and 僉 (CO, originally ‘many people agree’: see 500) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either ‘gather together’ (Katō, Yamada), giving ‘hills/mountains grouped together’, or ‘jagged, pointed, steep’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), giving ‘jagged/steep hills/mountains’, and ‘steep’ as a generalized meaning. Either interpretation leads to ‘dangerous’ as an extended meaning. KJ1970:375; TA1965:847-8; OT1968:1069. We suggest taking as ‘odd’ elder brother 兄 114 under cover/cap 亼 .

Has 玉 15 ‘jade’ in its slightly abbreviated left-hand shape (minus the dot), and 見 20 ‘see’. Yamada takes as phonetic with associated sense ‘appear’, to give ‘luster of jade’, with ‘appear’ as a loan usage. ‘Luster of jade’ is supported by Qiu as original meaning for 現 , who also treats ‘appear’ as a loan usage for this graph. Ogawa, alternatively, takes 見 as semantic and phonetic, to give ‘luster of jade appears’, later generalized to ‘appear (before one’s eyes)’. YK1976:163-4; OT1968:657; QX2000:342.

鉱	KŌ	mineral,	L3	700	13	鉱物 [KŌBUTSU] - mineral; 鉱石 [KŌSEKI] - ore; 炭鉱 [TANKŌ] - colliery	Late graph, no seal form. Traditional form 鐄 . Originally written 磺 (CO; a seal form for this does exist) or 礦 . 磺 has 石 47 ‘stone, rock’, and 黃 (traditional form of 黄 133 ‘yellow’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘yellow’, to give ‘yellow rock’. Used originally for yellowish mineral-bearing rock (ore), and then extended to ‘ore’ in general. In the other similar graph 礦 , which importantly provides the link to the modern form, 廣 (traditional form of 広 127 ‘wide, extensive’) was substituted – probably as a phonetic loan – for 黃 133 based on their near-homophony in early Chinese. At a later stage, the 石 determinative in 礦 was replaced by 金 16 ‘metal’, to give 鑛 , which has been simplified in modern Japanese to 鉱 . KJ1970:325; YK1976:185; OT1968:1039; AS2007:285,266.

Extended use in figurative senses such as ‘take a posture’, and ‘pose as’. KJ170:404; YK1976:185; OT1968:518; MS1995:v1:110-11. We suggest taking 冓 as 井 1575 ‘well’ and 再 706 ‘again’.

KJ1970:404; YK1976:186; SS1984:315. As with 構 701 (‘build’, ‘to mind’), we suggest taking 冓 as 1575 井 ‘well(s)’ and 再 706 ‘again’.	THE LECTURE WAS A TALK ABOUT WELLS AGAIN	images/Chapter5_img_101.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 昆 1357 (NJK, originally ‘crawling insect’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘water spirals up from the ground’ (Katō, Yamada), echoed by Gu, who says ‘water flows abundantly’. Spiralling indicated ‘eddy’, then ‘mix’ and ‘confusion’. (Mizukami notes alternative possible analysis of 昆 as ‘many people gather in the sunlight’, but Katō disagrees.)

By extension, senses such as ‘edge’, ‘contact, come together’. KJ1970:425; YK1976:200; OT1968:1074; MS1995:v2:948-9.	FESTIVAL AT EDGE OF HILL IS QUITE AN OCCASION	images/Chapter5_img_109.jpg

Original way of writing was 襍 , consisting of 衤 ( 衣 ) 444 ‘(upper) garment, clothing’, and 集 324 (‘gather, collect’, originally birds gathering in a tree) as semantic and phonetic, to give ‘garment made of various colored cloths gathered together’. Subsequently the meaning became focused as ‘gather (a variety)’ and the shape modified to 雜 , which in turn led to the form 雑 used in modern Japanese writing, probably through earlier cursivizing. FC1974:v2:2396; KJ1970:432; YK1976:205; OT1968:1078. As a mnemonic, we suggest taking the modern graph’s three components, 集 bird(s)/gather, with 木 73 ‘tree’ and 九 13 ‘nine’.

Has 酉 318 (NJK, orig ‘wine jar’ &gt; ‘wine’), and 夋 (CO, ‘drag feet’; see 1470) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pierce, stab’, to give ‘alcohol-like liquid which [feels like it] stabs the tongue’; by extension, a range of meanings such as ‘sour, wine gone bad; vinegar’, ‘acid taste, acid’. KJ1970:60; YK1976:209-10; OT1968:1028. We suggest taking right hand part as ‘crossed legs’ 夂 (see Appendix), and ‘runny nose’ .

Has 貝 10 ‘shell/currency’, and 兟 ‘advance’ ( 先 51 ‘tip, precede’ reduplicated; in early Chinese also meant ‘go in front’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘put forward/present shell currency or valuables’ as a gift when meeting one’s lord. As this would facilitate the meeting, ‘help’ evolved as an extended sense. Yamada proposes ‘praise’ as a further extension of meaning. KJ1970:441-2; KJ1975:210; OT1968:958; ZY2009:v1:52; AS2007:527.

支	SHI,	branch,	L3	717	4	支店 [SHITEN] - branch office; 支持 [SHIJI] - support; 支え柱 [sasaebashira] - prop	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Represents a bamboo stalk or a branch with leaves attached, held in the hand; taken to signify pulling the branch or stalk away, and hence ‘separate (with the hand)’. The Shuowen explanation says ‘bamboo’ ( 竹 58), but not all commentators are convinced by such precise identification (Ogawa, Shirakawa). No doubt because the hand is supporting a branch or bamboo stalk, Ogawa regards ‘support’ as an extended meaning, and does not follow Yamada’s view that ‘support’ is a loan usage. In modern usage, 支 is often used for ‘support’ in a figurative sense (cf. 枝 719 ‘branch’). KJ1970:460; YK1976:212; OT1968:434; SS1984:359.

示	JI,	show,	L3	723	5	暗示 [ANJI] - hint; 展示 [TENJI] - display; 示し [shimeshi] - discipline	OBI forms , ; seal . Originally a picto-gram of an altar (also shown as 礻 ) for sacrifice to the gods. Theories about the shorter top horizontal line vary, and include a sacrifice, an ancestral tablet, or a deity image. The two lower sloping strokes are taken to indicate blood from a sacrifice, or ritual wine used for cleansing an offering. Despite some divergence on points of detail, there is agreement on the basic meaning of this graph as an altar. ‘Show’ may be an extended sense, related to outcome of the ritual involved.

似	JI,	resemble	L3	724	7	類似品 [RUIJIHIN] - imitation; 似非 [ese-*] - sham, phoney; 似合う [niau] - be suited	Bronze ; seal . Seal form has 亻 41 ‘person’, and or 厶 (not to be confused with katakana ム ) (originally possibly a person with a plow [i.e. ‘farmer], but see 以 443) as phonetic with associated sense ‘same appearance’, to give ‘a person’s appearance is the same as another’s’, hence ‘resemble’. KJ1970:479,13; YK1976:229; MS1995:v1:54-5; OT1968:151. Mnemonically challenging, but we suggest taking the right hand and left hand elements as persons, and the central element as a plow.

謝	SHA,	apologize,	L1	728	17	謝罪 [SHAZAI] - apology; 謝礼 [SHAREI] - remuneration; 感謝 [KANSHA] - gratitude	OBI ; seal . Seal form has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 射 893 (‘shoot arrow’) as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘depart’ (possibly with a semantic link also, with regard to an arrow leaving a bow), to give ‘words of farewell’. The meaning is considered to be extended to ‘words of thanks’ in the context of leaving after receiving a gift. Gu also makes this link, though he also proposes the above OBI equivalent, interpreting it as two hands holding up a mat taken away when departing government office, presumably with words of thanks (the same OBI form is interpreted differently by Mizukami, who sees it as an early predecessor of 識 – see 725). Gu’s interpretation involving a mat would appear to be reinforced by the OBI forms which Mizukami lists for 席 549 ‘seat’ (originally, pictograms of a mat, and interpreted in that way by Mizukami himself). MS1995:v2:1210-11,v1:440-41; KJ1970:490-91; YK1976:240; OT1968:941; GY2008:1514. As a mnemonic we suggest using the English slang term, ‘shoot off’, meaning depart (in some haste).

授	JU,	teach,	L3	729	11	授業 [JUGYŌ] - tuition; 授与 [JUYO] - confer; 教授 [KYŌJU] - tuition, professor	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). In early Chinese a word meaning ‘give’ was written with the graph 受 319 ‘receive’ (see OBI form for 319); in that early period the two words concerned, ‘give’ and ‘receive’, which were near-homophones, were distinguished in written texts on the basis of context. At the seal script stage, however, the ‘hand’ determinative 扌 ( 手 ) 34 was added to the near-homophone meaning ‘give’ so as to aid clarity. With regard to the case of 授 , the phonetic element 受 is more appropriately taken as ‘hand over’ (Katō) rather than ‘receive’ (Yamada). The meaning ‘teaching’ is an extended sense, with regard to conferring knowledge. KJ1970:507-8; AS2007:470; QX2000:189; YK1976:247. As a mnemonic, we suggest making use of three hands.	‘THIRD-HAND’ BATON IS USED FOR TEACHING	images/Chapter5_img_144.jpg

Has 行 131 ‘go’ and 朮 (originally hand with sticky grains: see also 731) as phonetic with associated sense ‘follow’ (Ogawa, Tōdō) or ‘bend, winding’ (Katō, Yamada), to give basic meaning ‘path’, or ‘winding’ (Katō, Yamada). Senses such as ‘means, method’ are seen as extended usage from following a path. This graph and 述 731 ‘relate’ are treated by Schuessler as representing the same basic word in early Chinese, and Tōdō also includes in the same word-family (‘follow a route’). OT1968:898; TA1965:682-6; KJ1970:527; YK1976:261; AS2007:473. As with 731, we suggest taking as ‘odd tree’.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 隼 (CO, ‘hawk’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull a rope straight’, giving ‘level surface of water’; later, meaning was generalised to ‘level’. Extended meanings ‘conform’ and ‘quasi-’ are based on keeping to or being close to a level or standard. 凖 (with 冫 401 ‘ice’ not ‘water’) is a variant form but now with separate status (see 1475). KJ1970:529; TA1965:682; YK1976:263. Suggest taking 隼 as 十 35 ‘ten’ and 隹 324 ‘bird’.	TEN BIRDS ON WATER, ALL AT SAME LEVEL	images/Chapter5_img_152.jpg

Has 广 127 ‘building, roof’, and 予 425 (originally ‘weaving shuttle’, modern meaning ‘prior, already’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘external wall’, to give ‘(external) house walls’. ‘Beginning’ may perhaps be a derived sense (what is there first, before roof and internal walls added); ‘order’, though, is regarded as a loan usage.

Alternatively, taken as ‘bend’, a meaning listed by Tōdō, based on 刀 198 ‘knife’ as phonetic in 召 , where it signifies ‘bend, bent’, based on curved shape of knife, to signify calling someone over with hand movement, i.e. ‘beckon’.

承	SHŌ,	receive,	L3	736	8	承知 [SHŌCHI] - consent; 承認 [SHŌNIN] - recognition; 継承者 [KEISHŌSHA] - successor	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). It comprises 手 34 ‘hand’, and 丞 (NJK, helping someone up, ‘lift up, help’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘raise up’, to give ‘lift up with the hands’, or ‘receive with hands held up’. Use of this graph seems to have related to ‘raise up’ and also ‘receive’ in a physical sense in early Chinese, and it came to be used in Japanese from quite an early stage with the latter meaning to represent a verb which, to give it its modern form, is uketamawaru ‘receive (from a superior)’, often to denote a verbal reference such as orders, and also historically as a polite verbal suffix. This background of use for 承 probably goes some way towards accounting for its additional senses in modern Japanese such as ‘hear’ and ‘know’. KJ1970:547-8; OT1968:403,19; YK1976:269; AS2007:185.

The traditional form consists of 言 118 ‘words; speak’, with 登 382 (‘climb’) as phonetic with an associated sense of ‘clarify’, to give ‘clarify with words, report facts clearly, prove’. The (originally) separate graph 証 once represented a near-homophone meaning ‘remonstrate’, but over time the simpler graph 証 came to be used in place of 證 , a choice made official in Japan in 1946. OT1968:924-5; AS2007:612; QX2000:313. We suggest taking the modern form as 言 118 ‘words’ with 正 43 ‘correct’.	CORRECT WORDS ARE PROOF	images/Chapter5_img_156.jpg; images/Chapter5_img_157.jpg

Has 犬 19 ‘dog’, and 爿 (taken originally as a stand or bed, or boards used in building earthen walls) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shape, appearance’, giving ‘appearance of a dog’; then generalized to ‘appearance, form, condition’; then extended to ‘written report on condition’ thus, ‘document, letter’.

Either interpretation then gives the generalized sense ‘heart’. Schuessler notes the related sense ‘feelings’, and also early use meaning ‘proper nature, circumstances’.

In the case of i], ‘sex’ may be seen as extended sense from ‘innate’, and ‘gender’ as an extension from ‘sex’, while with ii] the element 生 serves both a semantic and phonetic role.

Subsequently, so as to distinguish the two meanings, the determinative 艹 53 ‘plants’ was added to 埶 for ‘plant with effort’, while 力 was added for ‘vigor’, ‘force’, giving 勢 , after which 埶 fell into disuse. See also 藝 495 (traditional form of 芸 ‘art, skill’). KJ1970:354; YK1976:303; QX2000:329-30; AS2007:570-71. Take 坴 as 627 ‘mounds of earth’, and 丸 as ‘round’ 101.

The process of cleaning rice involved refining, hence ‘refine’. ‘Essence, spirit’ may be seen as an extended sense – that which remains after refining – and by further extension to ‘vitality’.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’ (Katō and Yamada consider ‘thread’ here to be hemp thread), and 責 751 (originally, ‘money requested’; ‘liability’, now ‘blame’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘link, join up’ (Katō, Yamada), to give ‘join up thread; spin’. Ogawa takes the associated sense of 責 as ‘accumulate’, giving ‘accumulate thread’ – a little awkward but helps explain ‘achievements’ as an extended sense. KJ1970:614; YK1976:310; OT1968:790.

Tōdō includes in a word-family ‘slender point; slender point thrusts in’, giving a clear original sexual connotation. TA1965:848-51; KJ1970:623; YK1976:311.

OBI form for 殳 170 (‘strike with weapon’) has hand holding object such as a club or mallet, held next to a wedge, to give ‘construct, establish’. Seal form onwards with 言 118 ‘words, speak’ is widely taken as an error; likely due to misinterpretation of certain older forms of 言 which include a wedge-shaped component.

Has 金 16 ‘metal/gold’ (in ancient China, often used for ‘bronze’), and 戔 545 (two halberds &gt; ‘fight, injure’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘tip is scraped away’, to give ‘metal implement with tip/edge scraped away’; taken to signify tools – often agricultural implements – such as spades, hoes, or knives. The connection with coinage and money is that, dating from the first millennium BC in China, there have survived examples of metal currency (separate from shell currency) actually in the shape of small knives or spades, and featuring short inscriptions; Qiu suggests that before the beginning of the formal use of money, spades probably served as a kind of currency in trade relations. In Japan, a new monetary system was adopted officially in 1871. The main unit in this decimal system was the yen, so called because the yen coins were round ( 円 4 ‘round, yen’), unlike the earlier oblong coins. As a lesser monetary unit, the ‘sen’ was adopted (one-hundredth of a yen); sen coins are no longer legal as currency, but the sen is still used sometimes in financial transactions. KJ1970:626; YK1976:319; QX2000:258-9. We suggest for the first mnemonic taking 金 in its meaning of ‘gold’, and for the second,‘ money.

The graph consists of / 糸 29 ‘thread’ (‘silk thread’), and (originally, tree blossoms or leaves hanging down); the function and meaning of the latter element – which has been modified through simplification in the block script version – is disputed. One view takes as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘white’, to give ‘white silk’ (Katō, Yamada, Mizukami), or ‘separate into two’ (Mizukami), to give ‘white silk threads hanging separately’. Tōdō, by contrast, considers ‘white threads/silk’ to be an extended sense, and the original meaning to be ‘the original state’. Normally, however, the words and meanings represented by individual graphs progress from the concrete to the abstract, not vice versa, so the first interpretation above is probably the one to follow. Yamada gives a useful view regarding the overall semantic progression for this graph, namely ‘white silk’ generalized to ‘white’, then to ‘plain’ and ‘raw material’; ‘element’ may be regarded as coming within the same semantic spectrum. Mizukami looks to identify a corresponding bronze form. KJ1970:640; YK1976:323; MS1995:v2:1008-9,v1:22; TA1965:368-71.

Has , corresponding to seal form of 尾 1888 (originally showing vagina with hair, later ‘buttocks’ and ‘animal tail’), and 蜀 (NJK, ‘green caterpillar’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘continue’, to give ‘born continuously/successively from vagina’ and hence ‘blood relatives, family’. By extension, ‘connected, belong, same type’. KJ1970:337; MS1995:v1:406-8,v2:1148-9; KJ1970:558; OT1968:298. Suggest take 尸 as ‘buttock’, 虫 as ‘insect’ 60, as ‘legs’, and ノ as ‘head’.

退	TAI,	retreat,	L3	769	9	後退 [KŌTAI] - retreat; 退職 [TAISHOKU] - retirement; 退位 [TAII] - abdication	Seal forms include , . Analyses vary, but the most convincing takes the first seal form as comprising 彳 131 ‘move, go’, and 日 66 ‘sun’, with 夂 ‘foot going down’ (see 213), to give ‘sun goes down’, and by extension ‘retreat’. The second seal form here has 辶 85 ‘move, go’, and this reflects a widely discernible feature in the older forms of certain graphs, which exhibit variation between 彳 and the semantically close 辶 . Mizukami looks to identify two possible bronze forms for 退 . Distinguish 艮 here from the same-shaped element ‘stop and stare back’ in 銀 281 ‘silver’ (though a useful mnemonic), and from 良 628 ‘good’.

Has 貝 10 ‘shell/currency/money’, and 代 358 (‘replace’, ‘fee’) as phonetic, taken either as ‘give’, meaning ‘give money/valuables’ (Katō, Yamada) or as ‘in turn’, meaning ‘one person lends and another borrows’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Yamada lists a possible bronze form also. KJ1970:889; YK1976:345; TA1965:90-92; OT1968:955.	LOAN IS REPLACEMENT MONEY	images/Chapter5_img_200.jpg

Has 心 164 ‘mind, heart’, and 能 787 (‘ability, can’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘good, beautiful’ (Katō, Yamada), to give ‘good/beautiful mind’; the sense ‘appearance, state’ is taken as a loan usage by Yamada, but Katō sees it as a generalized sense.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 是 1574 (originally, pictograph of spoon on a hook; now ‘proper, this’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hold in the hand (something hanging down)’, to give ‘hold, carry’. In Tōdō’s word-family ‘straight’, meaning ‘hold straight up’ (the object is vertical, so does not conflict significantly with the other interpretation noted above). ‘Offer’ is an extended sense.

The graph has 禾 87 ‘grain’, with 呈 (modern form 呈 1741 ‘express clearly’; itself comprising 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, with [CO ‘stand up straight’, ‘excel’] as phonetic with associated sense ‘show’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put in order’ (Yamada, Katō) or ‘extend straight’ (Ogawa), to give ‘order, rule, standard’. Katō notes a connection with a unit of measure (‘put grain harvest in order by units of volume’). ‘About, approximately’ may be a further extension of meaning on the basis of being close to a standard. YK1976:375; KJ1970:709-10; OT1968:734; MS1995:v1:262-3; KZ2001:1877/3671. Take 王 as ‘king’ 5.

Mizukami lists an OBI for 適 (lacks determinative 辶 ). ‘Suitable, fit’ are loan usages. MS1995:v2:1306-7; YK1976:376; KJ1970:720; OT1968:1012,186.

Has 犭 ( 犬 ) 19 ‘dog’, and NJK 蜀 766 (originally, ‘green caterpillar’) as phonetic with associated sense here of ‘fight’, to give ‘dogs fight, coming together as one’, and extended sense ‘(just) one, alone’. In written style, 独 is sometimes used as an abbreviated way of writing ‘Germany’, as in for example 英独 ‘Anglo-German’. In recent times 蜀 ‘caterpillar’ has been simplified in this graph to 虫 60 ‘insect’. KJ1970:741; YK1976:396-7; OT1968:642.	INSECT-RIDDEN GERMAN SHEPHERD DOG IS LEFT ALONE	images/248a.jpg

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 壬 (‘spool, spindle’: different from similarly-shaped element in 777, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bag’, to give ‘carry a load on the back’. ‘Baggage’ is an extended sense, and ‘duty’ a further abstracted sense. Yamada looks to identify several OBI forms, but Mizukami does not include any. YK1976:401-2; KJ1970:567; OT1968:51. We suggest taking 壬 as an ‘odd’ variant of ‘king’ 王 5.

The original graph for this word for ‘burn’ was 然 557, but when 然 came to be used frequently to represent other linguistic forms, a second 火 8 ‘fire, flames’ was added to clearly indicate the meaning ‘burn’.

Has 刂 198 ‘knife/cut’, and 半 214 (‘half’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘divide in two’, to give ‘divide in two physically with knife/cleaver’. Later, extended to‘divide’ in general, and further senses such as ‘dissect’ and ‘decide, judge’. The meaning‘seal’ (Japanese only) seems to relate to early practice of dividing important documents with seals (similar to signatures in the West) such as contracts in two, one half for each party.

Has 片 980 ‘strip’ (orig thin pieces of wood), and 反 393 (‘oppose’, ‘measure’), as phonetic with associated sense ‘flat, thin’, thus ‘flat/thin board’. In early times this graph denoted wooden strips/tablets as writing material, paper being very expensive. Technological development in China in first millennium AD saw 版 used to refer to wooden blocks engraved with text and/or illustrations in woodblock printing, and widely in printing terms.

Original meaning ‘lined up’ was extended based on comparing two similar entities. Originally, early Chinese words for ‘lined up’ and ‘follow’ were both represented in written form by one person next to another, and as Mizukami points out, OBI for these two words were written sometimes facing right, sometimes left; later the convention became established to write facing right for this graph 比 , and ‘follow’ (block script 从 [the original way of writing 従 – see 902]) facing left.

Has 月 / 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and a right-hand element which in the seal form corresponds to 卩 ‘kneeling person’ (determinative 26) though Katō and Yamada take here as ‘hunchback’. In this graph 巴 162 serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘one thing added on top of another’, to give ‘fleshy’; by extension, ‘become fat/enriched’. It is in Tōdō’s word-family ‘fat, thick’. YK1976:422; KJ1970:798; TA1965:730-32. We suggest taking the right-hand element as ‘bending body’ 巴 162.	FLESHY BENDING BODY HAS BEEN FATTENED	images/Chapter5_img_230.jpg

Has 亻 41 person’, and 表 402 (‘surface, list, appear’) as phonetic. Most commentators do not give an associated sense for 表 . One exception is Katō, who refers to a light illness quickly recovered from; and Yamada, who says ‘move nimbly’, giving an overall sense ‘nimble person’, on the basis that 俵 is perhaps a variant form of another graph similar in pronunciation, i.e. 僄 , CO meaning ‘light, nimble’; Katō shares this view. In the Yupian dictionary the meaning of 俵 is noted as ‘distribute’, though Katō notes 俵 was also sometimes used in Han time texts in the sense of 表 . In Japanese only, 俵 is used exclusively with a different meaning, i.e. ‘bag, sack (for rice, etc.)’. The word DOHYŌ ( 土俵 ) means ‘sumo wrestling ring’ as well as ‘bag filled with sand (or similar)’, but this just reflects the fact that traditionally the ring is formed with sandbags. The explanation for use of 俵 for ‘sack, bag’ in Japanese may be that 表 originally referred to an enveloping outer garment, and similarly a bag or sack is itself an enveloping cover.

Has 衤 / 衣 444 ‘garment, clothing’, and 复 (‘go back’, see 803) as phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate’, to give ‘garment of several layers, lined garment’. Later, the association with garment was lost, and ‘accumulate’ became the dominant meaning; ‘duplicate, again’ are extended senses. YK1976:439; KJ1970:830; TA1968:237; OT1968:908. As with 803, we suggest taking the right hand part as 夂 ‘crossed legs’, 日 66 ‘sun’, and  as variant of 人 41 ‘person’.	PERSON SITTING CROSS-LEGGED IN SUN WITH DOUBLE CLOTHING!	images/253a.jpg

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 弗 596 (originally ‘cut/untie two things tied together’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘indistinguishably similar’ (Katō differs, saying ‘covered and not clearly visible’), to give ‘people indistinguishably similar’. The meaning ‘Buddha’ (full way of writing is 仏陀 ) is a loan usage; phonetic writings for Sanskrit Buddhist terms were employed extensively. Buddhism was introduced into Japan in about the sixth century AD. OT1968:43; YK1976:439; KJ1970:832-3. We suggest taking ム as a nose.

Consists of 阝 1907 ’hill, piled-up earth’, with 方 223 (‘side, direction’) as semantic and phonetic, to give ‘(terraced) hill/mound on both sides’, i.e. ‘embankment’; a preventative feature, leading by extension to ‘prevent’. YK1976:456-7; KJ1970:763; OT1968:1064. For further discussion regarding the right-hand forms of 阝 see 1907.	DEFENSIVE TERRACED HILL TO ONE SIDE PREVENTS ATTACK	images/255a.jpg

暴	BŌ,	violence,	L3	814	15	暴力 [BŌRYOKU] - violence; 暴露 [BAKURO] - exposure; 暴れ者 [abaremono] - roughneck	Seal forms i] , ii] . Seal forms vary in shape (Yamada lists three, including i] and ii]). Amidst such variation, the form with 米 220 ‘rice’ is considered to be the correct semantic element, combining with another component; Qiu notes that the form with 米 occurs on Qin dynasty (221-206BC) bamboo slips (clerical script). Commentators vary in their interpretation of the component which is combined with 米 , but those proposed, which include 曓 (‘sudden illness’) (Yamada), are taken as serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘expose to the sun’, giving the overall sense ‘dry rice by exposing to the sun’; later, the sense was generalized to ‘expose to the sun’. Mizukami lists what he treats as a bronze equivalent for 暴 which is of different structure, being ‘sun’ with an element thought to represent an animal, again meaning ‘expose to the sun’, in this case as a sacrifice. The meaning ‘violence’ is probably a loan usage. In the block script form 暴 , the bottom element is in error for 米 . YK1976:458-9; MS1995:v1:626-7; QX2000:200-01; KJ1970:776-7; OT1968:474. We suggest taking the components as 日 66 ‘sun’, 共 484 ‘together’, and 氺 as ‘insufficient water’ ( 水 42).

夢	MU,	dream	L3	816	13	夢中 [MUCHŪ] - absorbed; 悪夢 [AKUMU] - nightmare; 夢見る [yumemiru] - fancy, dream	Seal form A ; seal form B . Shuowen has as separate entries, seemingly taking them as representing same word ‘dream’. Form B, later prevailing, has 夕 46 ‘moon, night’ and as phonetic with associated sense ‘cannot see clearly; dark’, in one view ‘dark night’ (Katō, Ogawa; for them ‘dream’ is loan usage). Form A includes 宀 30 ‘roof, building’ and 爿 739 ‘bed’, but Qiu feels these were misunderstood by Shuowen compiler Xu Shen. Later, top four strokes of Form B were written as 艹 53 ‘plants’. KJ1970:848; DJ2009:553,601-2; QX2000:230-31; OT1968:232. Take 艹 as ‘grass’ 53, 76 as ‘eye(s)’, and 冖 as cover.

Has 辶 (辵) 85 ‘road; walk’, and 米 220 (‘rice’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘unclear’, to give ‘walk without clear direction, become lost’; by extension, ‘become perplexed’.

綿	MEN,	cotton,	L3	818	14	木綿 [MOMEN*] - cotton; 綿毛 [watage] - down, fluff; 綿菓子 [watagashi] - candy floss	Seal ; late graph (post- Shuowen ). Seal form has right and left elements switched. ( 帛 has 巾 1232 [‘cloth’, originally tucked into belt], and 白 69 ‘white’ &gt; ‘white [silk] cloth’), with 系 855 (‘join fine threads’), thus overall sense ‘join white silk threads’. In block script form, 糸 29 may be abbreviation of 系 . Closely related to 綿 is 棉 ‘cotton’ (NJK, originally tree-cotton [ 木 73 ‘tree’]). YK19 76:470-71; KJ1970:872; MS1995:v1:438-9; QX2000:300,334.

輸	YU	transport,	L3	819	16	輸出 [YUSHUTSU] - export; 輸送 [YUSŌ] - transportation; 運輸 [UNYU] - transportation	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 車 33 ‘cart, vehicle’, and 兪 (comprising 舟 1450 ‘boat’, with element taken as ‘blade for gouging out’ or ‘cast-off outer layer of cicada, etc.’ [Mizukami], giving original sense ‘boat made by scraping out inner part of log, leaving outer part’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘move (something)’; resultant overall meaning is ‘transport goods by vehicle’.YK1976:477; KJ1970:881; MS1995:v1:100-01; OT1968:987. We suggest taking 亼 as cover, 刂 as ‘cut’ 198, and 月 as ‘meat’ 209.	COVERED CART IS TRANSPORTING CUT MEAT	images/257a.jpg

Has 頁 103 ‘head’ (considered here to denote ‘facial expression’), and 予 425 (‘weaving shuttle’, now means ‘already’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘at ease, relaxed’, to give ‘relaxed facial expression’ and by extension ‘enjoy’. ‘Deposit’ and ‘look after’ are loan usages.

Has 田 63 ‘rice-field’, and 各 462 (‘each, every’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘divide, demarcate’, to give ‘divide fields, boundaries between fields’; Ogawa attributes the more general sense ‘measure land’. ‘Approximately’, ‘outline’, and ‘abbreviation’ are loan usages.

Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 令 633 (‘order, rule over’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘upright’, to give ‘upright part of the head’, i.e. ‘neck’. The current meanings are perhaps extended senses, based on the concept of the head being a chief part and derivates from that. YK1976:499; KJ1970:917; OT1968:1104; AS2007:318. We suggest taking 令 in its meaning of ‘rule’.	CONTROL REQUIRES THE HEAD TO RULE	images/Chapter5_img_282.jpg

Has 或 either i] , variant of 畺 ‘boundary’ (see 91), with 弋 311 ‘stake’ (here ‘marker peg’), thus ‘field boundaries with marker stakes’, or ii] 囗 84/136 ‘enclosed area’ with 戈 545 ‘halberd’, giving ‘defend demarcated area with weaponry’. 土 64 ‘ground’ was added later, probably to distinguish 或 in the above original boundary-related sense from its later uses to represent other more abstract words. MS1995:v1:536-7; YK1976:56-7; KJ1970:27-8; OT1968:217. Suggest taking 口 as entrance, and as one/sole.

YK1976:70; MS1995:v1:204-5; KJ1970:105-6; OT1968:564. We suggest taking as ‘eight’ 八 70 ‘openings’ 口 22.

Has 門 231 ‘gate’, and 各 462 (originally, ‘descend [and stop]’; now ‘each’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘descend and stop’, giving ‘securing bolt’ (vertical bolts used to keep leaves of a gate in place without moving). Senses such as ‘mansion, chamber, Cabinet’ are loan usages. YK1976:96; KJ1970:192-3; OT1968:1059.	EACH GATE LEADS TO CABINET	images/Chapter6_img_18.jpg
割	KATSU,	divide,	L3	838	12	分割 [BUNKATSU] - division; 割引 [waribiki] - discount; 割合 [wariai] - rate		AT ANY RATE, WHEN DIVIDING, CUT OUT HARMFUL BITS	
株	kabu	stock,	L1	839	10	切り株 [kirikabu] - stump; 株式 [kabuSHIKI] - stocks, shares; 株主 [kabunushi] - stockholder	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 朱 1439 (originally ‘tree trunk’, now ‘vermilion’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘center of tree is red’ (Yamada), or ‘come together’ (Ogawa; a reference to where the branches of a tree all emanate from); Katō also takes as ‘center of tree’. Later used also for ‘tree stump’. The meaning ‘stocks, shares (in a company)’ seems to be an extended use which refers to the central supporting part of a firm/company.YK1976:99-100; AS2007:625; OT1968:505; KJ1970:506.

干	KAN,	dry,	L3	840	3	干潮 [KANCHŌ] - ebb tide; 干上がる [hiagaru] - dry up; 干し肉 [hoshiNIKU] - dried meat	OBI . Originally depicted a forked weapon, possibly made from a tree branch; appears to be a simpler version of the weapon originally represented by 単 569, possibly with a handguard. The later sense ‘shield’ is considered a loan usage (Ogawa suggests instead that this occurred through confusion with old forms of 盾 1474, but there is limited similarity in shape). Yamada considers the meaning ‘dry’ reflects use of 干 as a loan graph for the more complex 乾 1145 ‘dry’ (homophonous in early Chinese, as in modern Japanese).

巻	KAN,	roll,	L3	841	9	第一巻 [DAIIKKAN] - Volume One; 巻物 [makimono] - scroll; 糸巻き [itomaki] - bobbin	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form: 卷 . Has 卩 41 ‘person kneeling’ (Katō and Yamada take here with extended sense ‘bent knee’), and (originally ‘scatter grain seeds by hand’: see 688) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shape into ball, bend, curve’, to give overall meaning ‘bent knee’; later generalized to ‘bend, wind’. Traditionally in China and Japan, books were made by binding into rolls, hence the meaning ‘(book) volume’ also. YK1976:102; MS1995:v1:176-7; KJ1970:178-9; OT1968:147. As with 688, we suggest taking as ‘two’ 二 65, ‘fires’ 火 8, and ‘self’ 己 866.	ROLL ONESELF UP BETWEEN TWO FIRES	images/Chapter6_img_22.jpg; images/Chapter6_img_23.jpg; images/Chapter6_img_23.jpg
看	KAN	watch	L3	842	9	看護婦 [KANGOFU] - nurse; 看板 [KANBAN] - signboard; 看守 [KANSHU] - warder	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). There are two types of seal form. One consists of 手 34 ‘hand’ over 目 76 ‘eye’, while the other comprises 目 ‘eye’ with 倝 (‘sun shining high in the sky’: see 667) as phonetic with associated sense ‘watch stealthily’. The interpretation of both forms is ‘watch with gaze shielded by the hand’ (Katō, Yamada), though Ogawa says ‘look into the distance’. YK1976:102; KJ1970:212-3; OT1968:696.

簡	KAN	simple,	L3	843	18	簡単 [KANTAN] - simple; 書簡 [SHOKAN] - letter; 簡略 [KANRYAKU] - concision	Seal . Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 閒 (the old form of 間 100 ‘space, gap’), typically taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘come apart’, giving ‘loose bamboo (writing) strips’; later generalized to ‘writing strip, tag’, and by extension ‘book, letter’. Ogawa says associated phonetic sense is ‘scrape’, to give ‘(bamboo) strip for writing’. YK1976:107; MS1995:v2:992-3; OT1968:758; KJ1970:218.

危	KI, abu	dangerous	L3	844	6	危機 [KIKI] - crisis; 危険 [KIKEN] - danger; 危害 [KIGAI] - harm	Seal ( Shuowen ); 厃 (earlier form of 危 ) . Scholars take 厃 as the simpler form of 危 . 厃 depicts a person kneeling or squatting down fearfully on top of a cliff or roof; to this, the later, more complex form 危 adds an additional element for ‘kneel/bend’, (see 789), which is regarded as both semantic and phonetic in function. The overall sense ‘kneel/crouch down fearfully on top of a cliff/roof’ gives rise to ‘dangerous, afraid’ as the extended sense. Mizukami also lists a proposed OBI equivalent, but the shape is not convincing. YK1976:109-10; MS1995:v1:178-9; KJ1970:249-50; OT1968:146. We suggest taking as fallen figure.

机	KI,	desk,	L3	845	6	机上 [KIJŌ] - theoretical; 机辺 [KIHEN] - around the table; 事務机 [JIMUtsukue] - office desk	Seal: ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and NJK 几 (originally, pictograph of table or desk) which serves as semantic and phonetic. Originally, 机 referred to a type of tree (a variety of elm), but was borrowed at an early period for ‘desk, table’. YK1976:110; KJ1970:236; OT1968:488,107; SS1984:140.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 軍 490 (‘army’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake’, giving ‘shake hands (after washing or similar, not a handshake)’; the meaning ‘direct, command’ is a loan usage.

貴	KI,	precious,	L1	847	12	貴族 [KIZOKU] - nobility; 貴重 [KICHŌ] - precious; 貴方 [KIHŌ/anata*] - you	Seal . Has 貝 10 ‘shell, shell currency’, and 臾 (NJK graph, originally a large basket [for carrying soil, etc.]) as a phonetic with an associated sense of ‘pile up high’, thus giving ‘pile shell currency/valuables up high’. This was then generalized to ‘precious’, and by extension to ‘noble’. Mizukami looks to identify equivalent OBI and bronze forms, though these lack the element 貝 .YK1976:117; MS1995:v2:1234-5; KJ1970:245-6; GY2008:855. As a mnemonic we suggest taking 貝 in its original meaning of shell, and the upper part as a ‘strange’ variant of 虫 60 ‘insect’.	STRANGE INSECT EMERGES FROM PRECIOUS SHELL	images/265a.jpg

Has 口 22 ‘mouth’, and 及 1202 (‘reach, extend’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull, pull in’ (Ogawa says ‘breathe in’), giving ‘pull in breath, inhale; suck in’.

供	KYŌ,	offer,	L3	850	8	提供 [TEIKYŌ] - offer; 供養 [KUYŌ] - memorial service; 供回り [tomomawari] - retinue	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 共 484 (originally, ‘offer up’; ‘all together’) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘offer, provide’. In terms of etymology and historical usage, there is much overlap between 供 and 共 , as noted by Qiu. ‘Companion’ is probably an extended meaning. YK1976:131; KJ1970:272-3; OT1968:59; QX2000:189.

胸	KYŌ,	chest,	L3	851	10	胸部 [KYŌBU] - thorax; 胸毛 [munage] - chest hair; 度胸 [DOKYŌ] - heart, mettle	Seal form i] ; seal form ii] ( 匈 ) . Both are late graphs ( Shuowen ). The second seal form (ii]) is given as the main graph, comprising 勹 (‘embrace, envelop’: see 611), and 凶 1215 (originally ‘empty mouth’) as phonetic. 凶 is taken as having associated sense either ‘empty’, giving ‘empty space in the chest for breathing’, generalized to ‘chest’ (Katō, Yamada, Tōdō), or ‘be nervous/excited’, giving ‘feel uneasiness’ (Ogawa). The former interpretation seems persuasive. 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’ was added to what was originally just 匈 ( Shuowen has 匈 as the main entry heading, noting that it is sometimes written with 月 added).

Has 力 78 ‘strength, effort’, and 堇 (‘drought deity’; borrowed for ‘smear, paint; clay’; later 墐 ) as phonetic with associated sense ‘muscle power’ (Yamada, Katō), giving ‘work’, or ‘tighten, brace oneself’ (Ogawa), giving ‘exert energy’. OT1968:129,217; YK1976:140; KJ1970:294-5; MS1995:270-71. Here 艹 is not ‘plant’ 53, but we suggest use as such, and take as 生 44 ‘grow’ in (seed-) box 囗 .

筋	KIN,	muscle,	L1	854	12	筋肉 [KINNIKU] - muscle; 筋道 [sujimichi] - logic; 筋書き [sujigaki] - synopsis	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Typically taken as amalgamation in the shapes of i] 肋 (NJK ‘ribs’; originally 力 78 ‘strength, effort’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘ribs’, with 月 209 ‘flesh’), giving ‘ribbed lines’ (Katō), ‘prominent lines’ (Ogawa), together with ii] 竻 (CO, ‘lengthwise lines in bamboo’). The basic underlying meaning of 筋 is ‘distinct lines’, and hence ‘sinew, tendon, muscle’. YK1976:140; KJ1970293-4; OT1968:750.	BAMBOO HAS STRONG FLESHY THREAD-LIKE SINEWS	images/267a.jpg

劇	GEKI	drama,	L3	858	15	劇場 [GEKIJŌ] - theater; 劇的 [GEKITEKI] - dramatic; 悲劇 [HIGEKI] - tragedy	Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 刂 ( 刀 ) 198 ‘sword, cut’, and (mythical beast with tiger’s head) as phonetic with associated sense ‘extremely violent, extreme’. It is felt to be an erroneous variant, which should properly have 力 78 ‘strength, effort’, not 刀 ( 刂 ). Modern scholars typically analyze in terms of the version with 力 , and this approach is followed here. Thus taken as 力 ‘effort, strength’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘extremely violent, extreme’ (though Ogawa interprets as ‘busy’), giving ‘exert oneself to the utmost’. YK1976:152; KJ1970:362-3; SS1984:182-3; OT1968:122. We suggest taking as tiger (‘tiger determinative’: see 297 and 1301) with 豕 89 ‘pig’.	TIGER ATTACKS PIG WITH SWORD!?

激	GEKI,	agitated,	L1	859	16	感激 [KANGEKI] - deep emotion; 激化 [GEKKA] - intensification; 激しさ [hageshisa] - intensity	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 敫 (CO, original meaning disputed; ‘shining’ [Gu], or ‘hit’ [Shirakawa says ‘stimulate spirit of deceased by hitting’]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘hit hard’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), giving ‘waves hit hard’, and by extension ‘violent’. Katō takes as ‘rise up’, thus ‘water rises/jumps up’, but the view based on ‘hit hard’ seems preferable. SS1984:197,247; GY2008:1621; KJ1970:359-60; OT1968:609; TA1965:267.

May be picto-graph of entrance; hence ‘cave’ (often used as dwelling in ancient China) (Tōdō, Ogawa, Shirakawa). Yamada sees as 宀 30 ‘roof’, here ‘entrance’, with 八 as phonetic with associated sense ‘dig’, thus ‘dug-out dwelling/cave’. TA1965:707-10; OT1968:739; SS1984:248; YK1976:153. Take 八 as ‘eight’ 70.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and CO (orig. insect type) as semantic and phonetic with associated sense ‘pale yellow’, thus ‘pale yellow silk thread/cloth’; later ‘silk’. GY2008:427; KJ1970:381; YK1976:160; SS1984:262. Take 口 as ‘round’, 月 as ‘meat’ 209.	SILK THREADS WRAPPED ROUND MEAT	images/Chapter6_img_50.jpg; images/Chapter6_img_51.jpg
権	KEN,	right,	L3	862	15	権利 [KENRI] - (a) right; 権衡 [KENKŌ] - balance; 権化 [GONGE] - embodiment	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional . Has 木 73 ‘tree’, and 468 (‘crested bird’) as phonetic with associated sense either as ‘yellow’, giving ‘tree with yellow blossoms’ (Yamada), or with associated sense unknown, giving ‘a type of tree’ (Katō); either way, the precise type of tree is not known. Meanings such as ‘authority, right, balance’ represent a loan usage of 権 instead of , a CO graph of 扌 34 ‘hand’ with as phonetic with associated sense ‘fist-sized weights’ for scales, giving ‘scales with weights for balancing by hand’ (Katō); Ogawa, alternatively, takes the weights as hanging, and supports this with an illustration of a weight in a bell shape which was made for hanging. At first weights were made of stone, but later metal. The operator of the scales had some discretion when weighing items, thus giving extended senses such as ‘balance’ and ‘power, authority’. In Japanese, ‘balance’ is now a very minor meaning for 権 . KJ1970:341-2; YK1976:160; OT1968:522.

Has 口 22 ‘mouth’, and 乎 (NJK, originally ‘floating aquatic plant’ or ‘breath exhaled’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘go, leave’ (Ogawa says ‘breathe out’), giving ‘that which leaves the mouth’, and so ‘breathe out’ and by extension ‘call out, call’. Mizukami also notes ‘big’ as a possible associated sense for 乎 , giving ‘big voice which leaves the mouth’. YK1976:166-7; OT1968:175; MS1995:v1:18-19, 224-5; KJ1970:258-9.

Has 糸 29 ‘silk thread, thread’, and 工 125 (originally a type of tool, probably an ax-head, also ‘work’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pink’. Qiu suggests etymology of 紅 is more complex, indicating diversity of opinion over etymology. Schuessler notes meanings as including ‘pink’ and ‘red’.

Has 刂 198 ‘knife, cut’, and 亥 (NJK, ‘wild boar’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut into, mark, engrave’, giving ‘engrave wood with a knife’, though cutting up an animal was probably the original sense, as Shirakawa suggests. ‘Severe, intense’ is treated as an extended meaning by Schuessler. Yamada looks to identify several bronze forms. YK1976:188; KJ1970:144; OT1968:115; SS1984:321; AS2007:334. We suggest taking 亥 as variant of ‘threads, bindings’ 糸 29.

Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ (not just ‘rice’; foxtail millet was a common grain in ancient China), and (CO; originally, percussion instrument on wooden stand) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hard exterior’, giving ‘grain with husk intact’. Used to denote grains in general. YK1976:190; KJ1970:409; OT1968:735,546; AS2007:273. We suggest taking 殳 112 as hand holding threshing tool, 士 as ‘samurai’ 521, 冖 as cover, and ‘grain plant’ 禾 87.

困	KON,	be	L3	878	7	困難 [KONNAN] - trouble; 困苦 [KONKU] - hardship; 困った [komatta] - Damn it!	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations differ. One view takes as consisting of 囗 84 ‘enclosure’, here signifying ‘house’, and 木 73 ‘wood’, giving ‘securing device for gates’ (to prevent unauthorized entry) (Katō, Yamada). Alternatively, seen as 木 ‘tree’ with 囗 ‘confining enclosure’ to restrain growth (Tōdō, Ogawa). With either view, ‘be in difficulties’ may be regarded as an extended sense, though perhaps more convincingly in the latter interpretation. KJ1970:412-3; YK1976:191; TA1965:712-21; OT1968:204.

The older graph 沙 has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 少 160 ‘a few, a little’, giving ‘tiny stone particles suspended in water’, i.e. ‘sand’. Later, 石 47 ‘stone, rock’ was substituted for 氵 ‘water’. MS1995:v2:734-5; KJ1970:415-6; YK1976:193. Though incorrect, use 少 ‘little’ in the sense of ‘small’.	SAND COMPRISES LITTLE STONES	images/Chapter6_img_86.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 齊 (orig showing ears of grain [Mizukami, Ogawa, Tōdō], or three hairpins [Shirakawa]) as phonetic, but views differ over associated and overall senses. Katō takes phonetic as ‘clear’, thus ‘river with clear water’ (also, river name), but Shirakawa and Ogawa, while also noting as a river name, take 齊 as ‘cross over’, thus ‘cross over water’, and by extension ‘assist (people)’ and hence ‘accomplish, complete’. Another view takes 齊 as having associated sense ‘adjust’, to give ‘adjust flow (water volume) of a river’ so as to even out (without flooding, etc.; Tōdō), and thus ‘be/make uniform, settled’. KJ1970:586; TA1965:770-73; MS1995:v2:1524-5,786-7; OT1968:1171,590; SS1984:338. Suggest take as 文 72 ‘text’ and strange ‘moon’ 月 18.

Originally pictograph showing turtle/tortoise shells bound together, for divination (see Introduction under Oracle Bone Script). Later bamboo/wooden strips were used. The basic meaning ‘bound volume’ remained unchanged, though the more general sense ‘document’ also evolved.YK1976:203-4; MS1995:v1:108-9; KJ1970:440-41.

蚕	SAN,	silkworm	L1	885	10	蚕業 [SANGYŌ] - sericulture; 養蚕 [YŌSAN] - sericulture; 蚕豆 [soramame*] - broad bean	OBI ; seal ; traditional 蠶 . OBI form is pictograph of silkworm. Seal has 60 ‘insects’ and 朁 ( 曰 NJK ‘speak’, with 兓 [two hairpins] as phonetic with associated sense ‘insert’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘produce’ (Katō, Ogawa, Yamada), thus ‘insect which produces thread’ i.e. ‘silkworm’. Tōdō, however, takes associated sense as ‘enter narrow space’, and sees it to indicate burrowing, thus ‘insect that burrows (into mulberry leaves)’. The modern Japanese graph 蚕 serves as a simplified version of 蠶 , but is in origin a separate graph meaning ‘earthworm’. Note too that middle part of traditional form 蠶 is 曰 ‘speak’ (orig showing tongue in mouth), a determinative slightly different in shape from 日 66 ‘sun/day’ in traditional printed form, though the difference is obscured in modern Japanese usage, which usually has both as 日 .

Originally shows arrow shot from a bow and come to rest sticking up out of the ground (‘ground’ 土 64). The arrow has reached a certain point and stopped, giving the meaning ‘stop’. The arrow has also gone as far as it can reach, hence the meaning ‘(maximum) limit’ also. YK1976:218; QX2000:191; KJ1970:444-5; OT1968:833.

Has 禾 87 ‘grain’ (not just ‘rice’), and 厶 , which based on its OBI form is usually taken as corrupted version of 囗 84 ‘enclosure’ (Katō, Ogawa, Yamada), but Mizukami takes 厶 as ‘enclose and make one’s own’; either way, overall sense is ‘grain which is one’s own’. The ancient Chinese tax system required part of the harvest to be given up as tax, and what remained was denoted by the graph 私 ; ‘grain which is one’s own/mine’ subsequently became generalised to ‘private, I, me’. KJ1970:459-60; OT1968:727; YK1976:219; MS1995:v1:188-90; SS1984:357-8. Suggest taking 厶 as a nose.	THE GRAIN UNDER MY NOSE IS MINE AND PRIVATE	images/Chapter6_img_99.jpg

Has 女 37 ‘woman, female’, and 次 308 (‘next’) as phonetic with divergent analysis of the associated sense. One view takes it as ‘well-ordered, well arranged’, giving ‘woman of well-groomed and beautiful appearance’, later generalized to ‘appearance’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Another view posits a more convoluted progression of meaning, i.e. 次 with associated sense ‘captivating appearance’, giving ‘a woman’s captivating attitude/demeanor’, then changing back to ‘appearance’ (Katō, Yamada).

Has 言 118 ‘words, speak’, and 司 524 (‘official’, ‘administer’) as phonetic with divergent analyses. One commentator takes associated sense of 司 as ‘help, assist’, giving ‘helper word’, i.e. ‘grammatical particle/function word’ (Katō). Tōdō takes as ‘embellish, add modification’, giving ‘modifying word’, while Yamada regards sense as ‘inherit, follow’, to give ‘word to use as a link’, i.e. ‘grammatical particle/function word’. The specific senses noted above were later generalized to just ‘word’. KJ1970:458; TA1965:78; YK1976:224.	PARTS OF SPEECH ARE USED BY ADMINISTRATORS	images/276a.jpg

若	JAKU,	young,	L3	896	8	若年 [JAKUNEN] - youth; 若者 [wakamono] - youth; 若しくは [moshikuwa] - or else	OBI ( ) ; seal . Views diverge. OBI form has just a raised pair of hands, and an element taken as dishevelled hair, together interpreted as meaning a shamaness dancing while shaking her hair wildly. Seal form on has 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’ added to , which itself reflects the original pair of raised hands having been changed to (misinterpreted as) 艹 53 ‘vegetation’. One view takes 若 as 口 ‘speak’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft, weak, supple’, giving ‘speak in compliant/submissive manner’ (Katō, Yamada). Another view treats instead as 艹 ‘vegetation’ with 右 2 (‘right’) in its original sense ‘hand’, giving ‘pick soft young leaves’ (Tōdō). Both views are noted by Mizukami. ‘If’ is a loan usage.

The overall sense is felt to be ‘search for and capture’ (Yamada, Katō, Mizukami); Mizukami also lists ‘bring together that which is separate/scattered’ as an alternative meaning.MS1995:v1:566-7,12-13; KJ1970:511-12; YK1976:248-9; OT1968:154.

Yamada’s interpretation results in ‘vertical’ as a loan usage (as also Katō), while in other analyses it is a generalized sense. The lesser meanings of ‘wayward’, ‘selfishness’ are extensions related to the idea of looseness (Katō). YK1976:257; TA1965:301; OT1968:787; KJ1985:488.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 宿 327 (‘lodge’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either i] ‘untangle’, giving ‘untangle thread’ (Tōdō, Yamada), or ii] ‘shrink’, giving ‘thread/cloth shrinks’ (Ogawa). In analysis i], ‘shrink’ is a loan usage. TA1965:211; YK1976:258-9; OT1968:789.	REDUCED TO THREAD-BARE LODGINGS	images/Chapter6_img_122.jpg

Has 罒 ( 网 ) 570 ‘net’, and 者 314 (‘person’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘set up, place’, giving ‘set up a net to catch birds and animals’. To catch these, there were beaters or assistants, each with their own role, and so by extension ‘role’, ‘post of duty’, and by further extension ‘government office’. ‘Sign, record’ are regarded as loan usages.

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 者 314 (originally, firewood piled up in container; ‘person’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘many, numerous’, giving ‘many words, eloquent’.

Has 阝 ( 阜 ) 1907 ‘hill, terraced slope, steps’, and 余 820 (‘excess’) as phonetic, taken as with associated sense either i] ‘order, arrange’, giving ‘well-arranged earthen steps’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘building’, taken on basis of Shuowen to give ‘palace steps’ (Gu, Tōdō).

将	SHŌ,	command,	L3	911	10	将来 [SHŌRAI] - future; 将軍 [SHŌGUN] - generalissimo; 将に [masa] - about to	Bronze ; seal ; traditional 將 . Bronze forms show one or two hands, with 月 ( 肉 ) 209 ‘meat, flesh’, with 爿 (originally, pictograph of a bed – see 739) as phonetic with associated sense ‘raise up’, giving ‘offer up meat’. Seal form has as above, but the ‘hand’ component is equivalent to 寸 920 (‘hand’, ‘unit of measure’), with little if any change of overall meaning, which is ‘offer up meat’. ‘Lead, command’ is considered to be either a loan usage (Katō, Yamada), or an extended sense based on the person making the offering being someone of status, hence ‘lead; leader’. Also used in early Chinese as a convenient loan for a grammatical function word meaning ‘be about to’, then also in Japanese. YK1976:271; KJ1970:582; AS2007:306.

Has 亻 41’person’, and (seemingly a variant of 昜 161 ‘sun rises’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘wound, injure’, giving ‘person suffers wound’, then generalized to ‘wound, injure’. Gu follows Shuowen in regarding as an abbreviation for with 矢 145 ‘arrow’ as left-hand determinative, meaning ‘arrow wound’. OT1968:78 YK1976:276; KJ1970:542-3; GY2008:283.

Has 阝 1907 ‘hill, terraced slope’, and 章 334 (‘badge, chapter’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either ‘prevent and support’ (Yamada) or ‘put up against’ (Tōdō), giving ‘mound/hill to prevent/separate’, or ‘fence (to separate)’ (Ogawa), giving ‘prevent with a surrounding hedge’. Schuessler gives the meaning as ‘dike, dam up’. All the above interpretations give ‘prevent, hinder’ as a generalized sense. YK1976:276; OT1968:1074; TA1965:352; AS2007:607.

Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 𠂹 (originally pictograph of blossoms and leaves hanging down; Kangxi zidian quotes Yupian , which treats as an old form of 垂 ) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hang down’, giving ‘land in remote regions’. Schuessler suggests the semantic progression ‘far end (of a place)’ &gt; ‘border, frontier’. Mizukami takes as ‘ends of the earth, where the sky hangs down’, a meaning perhaps related to ancient Chinese concepts of the Earth. ‘Hang down’ is a generalized sense.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 隹 324 (originally, pictograph of bird) as phonetic with associated sense ‘push away’, giving ‘push away with the hand’. Katō regards ‘guess, infer’ as a loan usage, but Schuessler says ‘push away, push, extend’, and on the basis of the latter ‘guess, infer’ could alternatively be considered an extended sense.

Seal form shows a pictograph for hand, together with horizontal stroke underneath. This stroke is typically taken as signifying one unit of measure (i.e. one ‘sun’) back from the wrist, giving ‘wrist pulse’ and by extension ‘measure’ (Yamada, Ogawa). Schuessler gives the meanings as ‘thumb; inch’, and lists ‘measure’ as a loan writing for a near-homophone of that meaning. YK1976:294-5; OT1968:285; KJ1970:579; AS2007:200.

Has 皿 300 ‘food vessel, bowl, dish’, and 成 545 (‘become, make, consist’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pile up’, giving ‘pile up food in vessel (as an offering)’.

Has 言 118 ‘words, speak’, and 成 545 (‘become, make, consist’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘lie on top of one another in layers, pile up’, and then presumed to mean ‘words and heart coincide’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘bring together’, giving ‘words come together’, taken as ‘words and conduct coincide’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘strictly observe’, giving ‘strictly observe what one says and not diverge from it’ (Ogawa). These interpretations appear to be based on a short entry for 誠 in Shuowen . YK1976:304-5; KJ1970:211-12; OT1968:929; TA1965:470-74.	WORDS BECOME SINCERE	images/285d.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 先 51 (‘tip’, ‘point’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘barefoot’, giving ‘pour water on bare feet’; Yamada regards ‘wash’ as a loan usage, but it seems more appropriate to take it as a generalized sense based on a more specific original meaning.

染	SEN,	dye,	L1	928	9	染色 [SENSHOKU] - dyeing; 染物 [somemono] - dyed goods; 染込む [shimikomu] - soak into	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Views vary. One takes as 氵 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 朵 (CO, vegetation or blossoms hanging on tree) as phonetic with associated sense ‘dangle in salty medium’, giving ‘soak (meat) in salty solution’; in this analysis, ‘dye (fabrics)’ is seen as extended sense through using a similar process, hanging cloth in a dye solution (Katō, Yamada). Tōdō analyzes as 氵 ‘water’ with 杂 , as variant form of 簋 , a CO denoting square container with a round inside, used to hold dye solution. Ogawa takes as 木 73 ‘tree’, with CO 氿 ‘oozing liquid’ &gt; ‘dye from vegetation’. YK1976:317; OT1968:575; TA1965:840-41; KJ1970:628-9.

Originally pictograph of simple shape depicting a lattice window; later, 穴 860 ‘hole, cave’ was added as a reinforcing determinative, resulting in 窗 . The seal form in Shuowen is equivalent to 窻 , which has 心 164 ‘heart, feeling’ added, but there is no satisfactory explanation of the role of 心 as yet. YK1976:328; OT1968:742; MS1995:v2:976-7; KJ1970:586. Suggest taking as ‘hole’ 穴 , ‘feeling’ 心 , and ‘nose’ ム .

Has 衣 444 ‘clothing’, and 壮 / 壯 1628 (‘manly, strong’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either i] ‘wrap clothing away’, giving ‘put away, prepare’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘long and slender/narrow’, giving ‘wear a long garment’ (Tōdō). The association with clothing appears to have given rise to the extended sense ‘gear/equipment’. ‘Adorn’ is a loan usage. OT1968:904; TA1965:378-80; DJ2009:v2:682. Suggest taking the components of 壮 , i.e. ‘bed’ 丬 739 and ‘samurai’ 士 521.	SAMURAI WEARS MANLY CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT IN BED	images/287a.jpg

Has 尸 , here not its usual ‘corpse, prone person’, but as abbreviation of 屋 meaning ‘roof, building’ (see 屋 256), and 曾 93 (orig. pictograph of double steamer) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘be piled up’, giving ‘building of two (or more) storeys’; later, sense was generalized to ‘pile up; layer’. Ogawa sees 尸 as an error for the different element 广 ‘building’ (e.g. 127). YK1976:329; KJ1970:320; OT1968:299. Suggest 尸 as ‘corpse’ 256, 丷 as variant of ‘eight’ 八 70, ‘field’ 田 63, and ‘day’ 日 66.

Has 艹 53 ‘plants’, and 臧 (interpreted in one view as ‘slave punished’, comprising ‘slave’ 臣 543 with 戕 ‘wound’) as phonetic with associated. sense taken as i] ‘cover over to avoid people’s gaze’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘put away’ (Ogawa), in either case giving ‘cover/hide under plants’, and by extension ‘store away; storehouse’. Qiu, though, considers 藏 originally denoted a type of plant, and treats ‘store away’ as a loan use. KJ1970:434; OT1968:871; YK1976:332-3; QX2000:341-2; MS1995:v2:1084-6.

存	SON,	exist,	L3	938	6	生存者 [SEIZONSHA] - survivor; 存在 [SONZAI] - existence; 存じる [ZONjiru] - know, think	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has (see 在 711), taken with possible meaning ‘blocked river’ or ‘be/exist’ (its precursor quite likely 才 139 [now meaning ‘talent’ q.v.]), and 子 27 ‘child’, widely taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘piled high’, thus ‘river blocked with piled soil’ (Katō, Yamada). Yamada also proposes extended senses ‘not move’ &gt; ‘stay, exist’. Ogawa treats as ‘exist’ and 子 as abbreviation of 孫 565 (‘descendants’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put in order’ extending to ‘exist, be’, but is unpersuasive. It is felt there is a link between 存 and 在 both as graphs and words in early Chinese, but uncertainty over the etymology of the graph 在 hampers our understanding of that for 存 . ‘Know, think’ seem to be extended or borrowed meanings.

Scholars agree that the original form of 擔 is 儋 , i.e. 亻 41 ‘person’, with 詹 as phonetic with associated sense ‘carry on the back’. In a later seal version, the left-hand determinative was changed from 亻 ’person’ to 扌 34 ‘hand’, giving 擔 , which can be seen as a variant form: the authoritative Kangxi zidian of 1716 lists 擔 as ‘the same as 儋 ’. The modern form 担 , which is treated as the abbreviated version of 擔 , is originally a graph of different meaning (‘strike, hit’) pressed into service as a substitute for the more complicated graph. YK1976:350; KJ1970:250; OT1968:408; ZY2009:v2:436,395. Suggest take right-hand part as ‘one’ 一 1 ‘day’ 日 66.	CARRY BURDEN IN HAND FOR ONE WHOLE DAY	images/Chapter6_img_173.jpg

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 延 831 (’extend, stretch, postpone’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘extend’, giving ‘words extend out/are excessive’, deceit’. While this is the original meaning, the graph occurs more commonly in early usage as a loan for ‘give birth’, according to Tōdō, but Schuessler does not list ‘give birth’ among the early Chinese meanings.

Initially the determinative for this graph was 火 8 ‘fire, flames’, but later a variant evolved with 日 66 ‘sun’; 火 / 日 combined with 爰 as phonetic with associated sense ‘warm’. 煖 gives ‘warmth of a fire’, and 暖 gives ‘warmth of the sun’; over time, the latter became the standard form. YK1976:354; KJ1970:685-6; OT1968:473,631. Suggest taking the right-side part as three hands (in a variety of forms)	THREE HANDS WARMING IN THE SUN	images/Chapter6_img_181.jpg

頂	CHŌ,	crown,	L3	951	11	頂点 [CHŌTEN] - apex; 頂上 [CHŌJŌ] - summit; 頂戴 [CHŌDAI] - receiving, please	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 丁 367 (originally pictograph of nail) as phonetic with associated sense ‘highest point’, giving ‘top of the head’; generalized to mean highest point, and hence ‘peak, summit’. According to Schuessler, in early Chinese homophones and near-homophones existed for ‘top of the head’ and ‘mountain top’; in similar fashion in Japanese, itadaki can mean ‘mountain top’ or ‘top of the head’, though the latter sense is relatively uncommon in modern Japanese. An extended sense in Japanese is ‘reverently accept’, from the traditional custom of raising a gift received to the head in thanks. The idea of receiving something has further extended to the meaning ‘please do something for me’. YK1976:366; OT1968:1100; GY2008:601; AS2007:211.

痛	TSŪ,	pain,	L3	954	12	頭痛 [ZUTSŪ] - headache; 痛手 [itade] - bad wound; 痛切 [TSŪSETSU] - poignant	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 疒 404 ‘sickbed/sickness’, and 甬 193 (interpretations include this as originally depicting a type of instrument [Ogawa; later, 筩 ], or a person stamping the ground surface down and jumping up [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pain as if stabbed’ (Ogawa), or ‘wound penetrates inside’ (Yamada, Katō); overall sense is ‘pain of sickness’, later generalized sense ‘pain’. YK1976:371; OT1968:679; MS1995:v2:870-71; KJ1970:735-6. Suggest associating 甬 with 通 193 (‘pass [through]’).	PAIN PASSES THROUGH SICK PERSON	images/293a.jpg
展	TEN	expand,	L3	955	10	発展 [HATTEN] - development; 展覧会 [TENRANKAI] - exhibition; 展望 [TENBŌ] - outlook	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 尸 256 (here) ‘person lying down’, and (as abbreviation of a more complex form with 衣 444 meaning a type of garment [Yamada says ‘red garment’]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘bend’, giving ‘person with bent back’, i.e. ‘hunchback’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘roll (over), tumble’, giving ‘turn in one’s sleep’ (Ogawa). Either analysis results in senses such as ‘lay (something) out, extend’ as loan usages. YK1976:379-80; KJ1970:728; OT1968:297. We suggest taking the top part as slumped person 尸 , middle part as 艹 53 ‘grass’, and lower part as ‘short’ clothing .

討	TŌ, u	attack,	L1	956	10	討議 [TŌGI] - debate; 討ち入る [uchiiru] - raid; 討伐 [TŌBATSU] - subjugation	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words, speak’, and 寸 920 (‘hand; measure’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘charge, accuse’, giving ‘charge verbally’, i.e. ‘charge (someone) with an offence’. Ogawa sees 寸 as an abbreviation here for 肘 (NJK ‘elbow’) with associated sense ‘capture’. ‘Attack (physically)’ can be seen as loan usage. Katō notes that in early times the elements corresponding to 寸 and 手 34 ‘hand’ were often used without distinction in meaning. YK1976:387-8; OT1968:923; KJ1970:673.

Has 黑 137 ‘black’, and 尚 1491 (orig. smoke rising from roof aperture; now ‘furthermore’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘cover’, giving ‘sun and moon covered in black, with no light’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘obstruct’, giving ‘obstructed and not clear’ (Ogawa). Either analysis could refer to a lattice roof-opening blackened with soot. ‘Party, (like-minded) companions’ are loan usage. YK1976:387; KJ1970:671-2; OT1968:90. Take as ornate roof, 兄 as ‘elder brother’ 114.	ELDER BROTHER’S PARTY MEETS UNDER ORNATE ROOF	images/Chapter6_img_198.jpg; images/Chapter6_img_199.jpg
糖	TŌ	sugar	L1	958	16	砂糖 [SATŌ] - sugar; 糖衣 [TŌI] - sugar coating; 糖分 [TŌBUN] - sugar content	Seal ; late graph (later Shuowen edition). Has 米 220 ‘rice’, and 唐 (orig. ‘incoherent, absurd’, itself comprising 口 22 ‘speak, words’, with 庚 [CO, here, slightly modified in shape; meaning ‘remove husk on grain’]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘spread out’ (Ogawa), or ‘dry using heat’ (Katō), giving ‘food items made using rice flour (spread out)’, and then more specifically ‘sweet items’, ‘sugar’. OT1968:764,327; YK1976:390; MS1995:v1:230-31; KJ1970:666. 唐 is also used to represent Tang China, helpful for mnemonics.	RICE FROM TANG CHINA IS AS SWEET AS SUGAR	images/294a.jpg
届	todo	deliver,	L3	959	8	届け書 [todokeSHO] - report; 届け出る [todokederu] - give notice; 行き届く [yukitodoku] - be attentive	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form: 屆 . The graph has 尸 256 ‘person lying down/slumped’ (possibly but not necessarily a ‘corpse’), and 凷 (CO, ‘lump of hard soil’, made up of 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, with 凵 [originally, ‘basket’] as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘hard and round’) serving as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘move backwards’ or ‘leg impediment’, giving ‘move backwards, cannot move freely’ (Yamada, Katō), or ii] ‘collapse’, giving ‘physically enervated’ (Ogawa). Schuessler notes early Chinese meanings that include ‘end up, arrive’, which appear to be loan usages; ‘deliver’, which may perhaps be regarded as an extended sense from ‘end up, arrive’, is a meaning for 届 used only in Japanese. YK1976:397; KJ1970:153-4; OT1968:295; AS2007:314. We suggest taking 尸 as a corpse, and 由 as ‘reason’ 421.	DELIVER CORPSE AND REPORT REASON	images/294b.jpg
難	NAN, muzuka	difficult,	L3	960	18	難民 [NANMIN] - refugees; 難儀 [NANGI] - trouble; 見難い [migatai] - hard to see		BIRDS ARE IN TROUBLE IN WATERLESS HAN CHINA	
乳	NYŪ,	breasts,	L3	961	8	牛乳 [GYŪNYŪ] - (cow’s) milk; 乳酸 [NYŪSAN] - lactic acid; 乳房 [NYŪBŌ/chibusa] - breasts	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Typically taken as 爫 (compact shape of 爪 1739, ‘claw, talon’ used in compound graphs), here meaning ‘hand’, and 孔 1316 ‘orifice, hole’ (originally ‘vaginal orifice’), giving ‘baby emerges from vaginal orifice and is received by hand’, i.e. ‘be born’. ‘Breast milk’ is treated by some (Katō, Yamada) as a loan usage, but can perhaps be regarded as an extended sense, as also ‘breasts’. Ogawa tentatively gives an alternative interpretation relating to an ancient belief, referred to in the Shuowen entry for 孔 , which links swallows to birth, but the first analysis above is probably the one to follow. YK1976:401; KJ1970:508; SS1984:670; OT1968:28. Note that 乚 is a cavity not a breast, though useful as a mnemonic. Thus we suggest ‘child’ 子 27 and 乚 ‘breast’ and ‘hand’ 爫 .

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 内 207 (‘inside’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘become wet’, giving ‘wet thread’; meanings such as ‘obtain; supply’ tend to be regarded as loan usages, though Tōdō notes an example of early classical usage of 納 in Chinese in the sense ‘bring inside’, a point echoed by Schuessler. YK1976:404-5; KJ1970:665; OT1968:770; TA1965:803; AS2007:446.	SUPPLY OF THREADS ARE STORED INSIDE, EASILY OBTAINED	images/Chapter6_img_203.jpg

For ‘brain’, Shuowen has 匘 , consisting of 𡿺 , originally a pictograph for ‘brain’ or ‘head, cranium’, with 匕 (the modern shape; originally, picto-graph for ‘withered leg’ and – by extension, based on the bent shape – borrowed for ‘ladle, spoon’ [Katō]; not to be confused with 七 32 ‘seven’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘fat, grease’, giving ‘fatty matter in the cranium’, i.e. ‘brain’ (Katō, Yamada). Alternatively, left side of seal form is taken as 人 41 ‘person’ (Shirakawa). Later, 匕 was replaced by 月 ( 肉 ) 209 ‘flesh, meat’. SS1984:675; YK1976:405; KJ1970:673-4,796; OT1968:823. We suggest taking 月 as body, and as ‘brain box’ with hairs on top.	THE BODY’S BRAIN-BOX IS MARKED WITH A CROSS, HAIRS ON TOP	images/Chapter6_img_204.jpg; images/Chapter6_img_205.jpg

背	HAI,	back,	L3	967	9	背後 [HAIGO] - background; 背中 [senaka] - back; 背信 [HAISHIN] - betrayal	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 北 224 (‘north’; originally, ‘turn the back, oppose’) as semantic and phonetic, giving overall meaning ‘the back’.

肺	HAI	lung(s)	L1	968	9	肺病 [HAIBYŌ] - lung disease; 肺炎 [HAIEN] - pneumonia; 肺臓 [HAIZŌ] - lungs	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 市 (originally pictograph of plant emerging above ground [not 144 ‘market/city’]), taken in one analysis as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge from within’, to give ‘body organ from which breath emerges’, i.e. ‘lungs’ (Katō, Yamada). An alternative analysis based on the seal form (and the Shuowen interpretation) of 市 takes original meaning as leaves of a plant opening on opposite sides, giving both semantic and phonetic with associated sense ‘divide in two’, to give ‘organ divided in two’ (lungs) (Katō, Ogawa). The first analysis above seems preferable; the second might apply equally to ‘kidneys’. Suggest taking 市 as ‘city’ for mnemonic purposes. YK1976:409; KJ1970:753,472; TA1965:651; OT1968:820.	MEAT FROM THE CITY MIGHT DAMAGE YOUR LUNGS	images/Chapter6_img_213.jpg
俳	HAI	amusement,	L1	969	10	俳優 [HAIYŪ] - actor; 俳句 [HAIKU] - haiku poetry; 俳人 [HAIJIN] - haiku poet	Seal . Analyses differ. Probably most persuasive is that which takes as 亻 41 ‘person’, and 非 794 (‘not’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hunchback, ugly’, to give ‘(male) hunchback’. In ancient China, the nobles had many dwarf servants who were hunchbacks, and who would tell amusing stories and perform song and dance routines at banquets; on the basis of such activities, extended senses evolved such as ‘jest’ for 俳 (Katō, Yamada). In support of this view is the fact that in medieval Europe deformed persons were often employed as jesters. Ogawa prefers to analyze 非 as phonetic with associated sense ‘oppose, go against’, giving ‘persons who amuse others by doing unusual things’. Yamada looks to identify a bronze form for 俳 .

晩	BAN	evening,	L3	971	12	晩飯 [BANmeshi] - evening meal; 晩夏 [BANKA] - late summer; 今晩は [KONBAN] - Good evening	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 日 66 ‘sun, day’, and 免 2018 (‘avoid, escape’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘disappear, not clearly visible’ (Ogawa says ‘incline towards’), giving ‘sun disappears’, i.e. ‘sunset’.

YK1976:422; OT1968:405,549; DJ2009:v3:995. Suggest 比 as ‘compare’ 792.

秘	HI,	(keep)	L1	974	10	秘密 [HIMITSU] - secret; 極秘 [GOKUHI] - top secret; 秘書 [HISHO] - secretary	Seal ( 祕 ). 秘 is a later popular form. 祕 has 示 723 (originally, ‘offering table, altar’, now means ‘show’), with 必 597 (‘necessarily’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘hide and not open’ (Yamada), ‘close’ (Ogawa), or ‘stick together and not allow movement’ (Tōdō), all signifying restriction in movement. Overall sense is ‘matters of the gods which are hidden and not clear/cannot leak outside’; later generalized to ‘hidden and not clear’, hence ‘secret’. The modern form using 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ as the determinative is probably a miscopying. YK1976:423; TA1965:765-9; OT1968:722; DJ2009:v1:5.	RICE PLANT IS NECESSARILY KEPT SECRET	images/298a.jpg
腹	FUKU,	belly,	L3	975	13	腹部 [FUKUBU] - abdomen; 中腹 [CHŪFUKU] - mid-slope; 腹立ち [haradachi] - anger	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 复 (CO, an upright vessel with another one upside-down underneath, and 夊 or 夂 [for further details, see under 復 803; also see Note below]) as phonetic in 腹 with associated sense either i] ‘thick and abundant’, giving ‘thick and swollen part of the body’ (Yamada), or ii] ‘cover’, giving ‘flesh covering the internal organs’ (Ogawa), with overall meaning in both analyses ‘belly, abdomen’. YK1976:438-9; OT1968:825; MS1995:v1:286-8,v2:1078-9; OT1968:173. Note: traditional form of 腹 has 夂 ‘descending foot’ (determinative no. 34), though in some early occurrences of this graph it may have been 夊 ‘walk slowly, drag foot’; see Appendix. Suggest 复 as 夂 as crossed legs, 日 66 as ‘sun’, and  as variant ‘person’ 41 人 .	PERSON SITS CROSS-LEGGED IN SUN, SHOWING FLESHY BELLY	images/Chapter6_img_222.jpg
奮	FUN,	be	L1	976	16	奮起 [FUNKI] - stirring; 奮闘 [FUNTŌ] - hard fight; 奮い立つ [furuitatsu] - be stirred		BIG BIRD IN FIELD STIRS, FLYING OFF EXCITEDLY

陛	HEI	majesty,	L1	978	10	陛下 [HEIKA] - Majesty; 陛見 [HEIKEN] - imperial audience; 両陛下 [RYŌHEIKA] - Majesties	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 阜 / 阝 1907 ‘earthen mound’, and CO 坒 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘be lined up/in a row’, to give ‘series of earthen steps’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Katō and Yamada take 阜 / 阝 here as ‘foothold’ (treating steps as providing firm footing), giving ‘footholds for climbing a hill’, and from this Yamada posits ‘steps to the Imperial Palace’ as an extended sense. OT1968:1068; TA1965:768; KJ1970:836; YK1976:444. Suggest taking 坒 as 比 792 ‘compare’ and 土 64 ‘earth’.	HIS MAJESTY’S THRONE COMPARES TO AN EARTHEN HILL!?	images/Chapter6_img_227.jpg
閉	HEI,	close,	L3	979	11	閉店 [HEITEN] - store closing; 閉口 [HEIKŌ] - dumbfounded; 閉め出す [shimedasu] - shut out		CLOSE GATE WITH WOODEN PROP	
片	HEN,	one	L3	980	4	断片 [DANPEN] - fragment; 片手 [katate] - one hand; 片付ける [katazukeru] - tidy up	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form shows that 片 represents one side of a tree (see 木 73) split or cut in half vertically, giving literally ‘split tree’, and hence ‘one side’. The split is probably conceptual, since to achieve this with ancient tools would have been extremely difficult. QX2000:204; YK1976:445; OT1968:633; KJ1970:787.	ONE SIDE OF A TREE IS SOME PIECE!	images/Chapter6_img_230.jpg
補	HO,	supplement,	L3	981	12	補助 [HOJO] - support; 補充 [HOJŪ] - supplement; 補強 [HOKYŌ] - reinforcement	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); Has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and NJK 甫 ; scholars dispute orig. meaning of latter (modern meanings inc ‘begin’). It is felt that what is now the one shape 甫 may have once represented two separate graphs of similar but different shape and meaning (Katō, with some support from Mizukami). One analysis of 甫 (analysis i]) takes the OBI and bronze forms as signifying ‘use an ax’, which is the Shuowen interpretation (&lt; 父 originally ‘hand holding ax’; now ‘father’ 216), over 用 ‘use’ (a loan meaning; 235); this is one analysis listed by Mizukami, though none of the OBI forms he lists actually support this – rather, they support the alternative view ii] which Mizukami lists, i.e. taking the OBI and bronze forms as representing a shoot of vegetation ( 屮 ) in a field or seedbed. Another credible interpretation – iii] – is offered by Shirakawa, who takes the early forms of 甫 as showing a sapling with a framework supporting the lower part (interestingly, the OBI form Shirakawa lists supports the ‘use an ax’ interpretation). While there is divergence over the original meaning(s) of 甫 , there does appear to be some agreement over the function of this element in 補 , i.e. that 甫 here serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘add on, patch’. Later, the idea of ‘garment’ was lost from 補 , leading to generalised meanings such as ‘repair’, ‘add on’. MS1995:v2:870-71,v1:256-8; YK1976:450; KJ1970:857; OT1968:905; SS1984:777. Suggest taking right side as ‘use’ 用 235, and ‘needle’ 十 35, plus point.	USE NEEDLE POINT TO MAKE GOOD SOME SUPPLEMENTARY CLOTHES	images/Chapter6_img_231.jpg

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 方 223 (‘direction; person’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘widely’, giving ‘inquire/consult widely’; ‘visit’ is a loan usage. TA1965:443; YK1976:454; AS2007:232.

棒	BŌ	pole,	L3	987	12	心棒 [SHINBŌ] - axle, shaft; 棒グラフ [BŌGURAFU] - bar graph; 棒紅 [BŌbeni] - lipstick	Seal ( 棓 ) . Shuowen has 棓 for this graph; 棒 is a later (post- Shuowen ) popular equivalent. 棓 comprises 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 咅 389 (CO ‘spit as sign of refusal’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘big stick’, giving ‘big stick’. Later 咅 was replaced by 奉 1954 (‘offer’, ‘respect’). YK1976:458; KJ1970:759; OT1968:513; SS1984:800. Suggest taking as ‘big’ 大 56, 二 as ‘two’ 65, and as club with two nails.

Has 巾 1232 ‘cloth’, and 莫 809 (originally depicted sun setting amongst trees or vegetation) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cover’, giving ‘cloth to cover’, and by extension ‘curtain; tent’. The military government (Shogunate 1192-1867) was known as the ‘tent government’ ( 幕 府 Bakufu, referring initially to a large tent acting as field HQ), and so Shogunate/Bakufu became an associated meaning for 幕 . YK1976:462; OT1968:319; KJ1970:774-5. Suggest taking 莫 as its original meaning ‘sunset’.	DRAMATIC VIEW OF SUNSET THROUGH CLOTH CURTAIN OF TENT	images/Chapter6_img_248.jpg

KJ1970:775; YK1976:471; OT1968:520. Suggest taking 莫 as ‘plant’ 艹 53, ‘sun’ 日 66, and ‘big’ 大 56.	PLANT COPIES MODEL TREE AND GROWS BIG IN THE SUN	images/303a.jpg

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 睪 (original meaning disputed; provisionally, ‘watch/observe criminals’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘change’ (Ogawa says ‘extract’), giving ‘change words/language’, and so ‘translate’. ‘Meaning’ is an associated or extended sense. YK1976:475; KJ1970:93-4; SS1984:50; OT1968:923. Take right part of modern form as person carrying backpack.	PERSON TRANSLATING CARRIES A LOAD OF WORDS IN BACKPACK	images/Chapter6_img_254.jpg

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 憂 2045 (‘grief, sorrow’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘dance with gestures’ (Tōdō and Ogawa also posit the sense ‘elegant’), giving ‘dancing person’ and by extension ‘actor’.

Has 欠 496 (originally, person yawning with mouth open wide; ‘lack, omit’), and 谷 135 (‘valley’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘continuous’ (Katō, Yamada), or ii] ‘about to eat’ (Ogawa), in either case giving ‘have mouth open’, and by extension ‘appetite’. Later extended to ‘desire’ and ‘greed’ in general. KJ1970:888; YK1976:486-7; OT1968:532.	GREEDY PERSON LACKS VALLEY SO DESIRES ONE	images/Chapter6_img_258.jpg

Several scholars take as a pictograph – Ogawa considers to originally denote frog spawn, and by extension ‘egg’; Tōdō is uncertain over the specific shape, but speculates to be possibly fish or insect eggs. The alternative treatment also takes as a pictograph, depicting not eggs but a pair of treadles on a loom, then borrowed on the basis of similarity in shape to represent ‘eggs’ (Katō, Yamada). The former view seems tentative, the latter more persuasive. OT1968:147; TA1965:555-6; KJ1970:146; YK1976:489-90. Suggest taking as frog spawn on stalks.

Based on classical Chinese usage, Shirakawa takes 覧 as action of high-ranking individuals, but Schuessler feels it may just represent a variant of the word represented by 監 1159.

Originally showing floor plan of pit dwelling in ancient China with entrances on the four sides, each linked to a separate room/space (in northern China, according to Mizukami). Misinterpreted in early times as showing hunchbacks (as for example in Shuowen ), leading to sense ‘inferior’, though in fact this sense is a loan usage, as is ‘come after, next’.

Use of 挨 in 挨拶 ‘greeting’ is loan usage, only in Japanese; in modern Chinese, core meaning of 挨 is ‘suffer’. TA1965:135-7; SS1984:7; DJ2009:v3:998. Take ム as nose and 矢 145 as ‘arrow’.

Note: Original meaning of 宛 is taken by Ogawa as ‘hemispherical roof’, but by Tōdō as referring to a person bending over. Present meanings are loan usages.

尉	I	military rank	L1	1019	11	大尉 [TAII] - captain; 少尉 [SHŌI] - ensign; 尉官 [IKAN] - company officer	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Seal form shows 火 8 ‘fire’ as lower element, and 寸 920 ‘hand/pulse’, combining with third element (represented by first few strokes of the modern graph) taken either as phonetic with associated sense ‘press down’ (Katō, Ogawa), or semantically as ‘buttocks, posterior’, but again giving rise to the meaning ‘press down’, in the latter analysis as an extended sense (Tōdō). Overall, the graph has the original meaning ‘iron’ (the hand-held implement; later written 熨 ). Already used in Han dynasty China as the name of a military rank (Qiu: ‘company grade military officer’). The latter sense appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:8-9; OT1968:288; SS1984:19; QX2000:135-6.

The wood was sometimes used for musical instruments as well as chairs; chair furniture was made in China from the Tang Dynasty onwards, initially only for the elite.

彙	I	compile, collect, classify		1023	13	彙報 [IHŌ] - bulletin; 語彙 [GOI] - vocabulary; 辞彙 [JII] - dictionary	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses vary. One takes as originally a pictograph of a hedgehog (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Alternatively, it is seen as abbreviation of NJK 彖 ‘wild boar; hedgehog’, with an abbreviation of 胃 447 (‘stomach’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘round, surround’, giving ‘animal which rolls into a ball’, again giving ‘hedgehog’ (Tōdō). Despite the diversity, scholars agree original meaning of 彙 is ‘hedgehog’; the later sense ‘collect’ is an extended sense, based on the large number of densely-packed spines the animal has, giving an impression of being collected together. OT1968:343; SS1984:21; TA1965:712-9. Suggest using 果 454 for its meaning ‘fruit tree’, with head part on top.	HEDGEHOGS ON TOP OF FRUIT TREES!?

Has 心 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, and 尉 1019 (‘military rank’, but originally meant ‘press down’), taken either as phonetic with associated sense i] ‘become angry’, giving ‘anger pent up in the heart’ (Katō), or ii] ‘press down’, giving ‘calm down the heart/feelings’ (Ogawa). In the former interpretation, ‘console’ is a loan usage. Mizukami looks to list a bronze equivalent. KJ1970:9; OT1968:384; MS1995:v1:522-3.

Has 壷 ‘wine jar (bulbous, narrow neck opening out at rim)’, and 吉 1196 (’auspicious’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘steamy, moldy’, thus ‘wine ferments and jar fills up’ (Yamada, Shirakawa, Ogawa). The sense ‘one’ is a loan usage, though possibly with a semantic component also, according to Qiu. YK1976:58; KJ1970:28-30; QX2000:120,275; SS1984:27-8.

Has 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation’, and 次 308 (‘next’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘arrange’ (or ‘stop’), giving ‘arrange plant material (on a roof)’, i.e. ‘thatch’. 次 is regarded as the original way of writing 茨 . Reflecting the trend in script development, from depicting the concrete to representing the abstract, it is believed that 次 was the original way of writing ‘miscanthus’ (and similar plants), after which the graph was borrowed for its sound value to represent ‘next’, with 艹 being added to indicate usage when in the sense ‘miscanthus’. Present meanings now include ‘thorn, bramble’. MS1995:696-7; DJ2009:v1:78; KJ1970:181-2.	THE NEXT PLANT AFTER THATCH IS BRIAR	images/Chapter7_img_27.jpg

All these interpretations are seen to involve a connotation of ‘excess’. Associated senses i] to iii] above give overall meaning ‘water oozes out’, ‘water soaks in’, while iv] gives ‘be heavily addicted to evil ways’; the latter is probably a later meaning, but now main one.

Has 阝 ( 阜 ) 1907 ‘hill, piled-up earth’, and (itself the earliest way of writing 陰 ) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘dark’, giving ‘dark side of a hill’, and hence ‘shade, shadow’. By extension, ‘secret’. In Chinese culture, also denotes the dark, negative principle ( yin ) in contrast to the bright, positive one ( 陽 yang ; see 429). Mizukami lists bronze equivalents also.

Shirakawa, in contrast, adopts a characteristically idiosyncratic, ritual-istic interpretation. OT1968:1074; KJ1970:62; ZY2009:v2:363; SS1984:34-5.

鬱	UTSU	melancholy, gloom, depression	L1	1039	29	鬱病 [UTSUBYŌ] - depression; 鬱気 [UKKI] - gloom, melancholy; 陰鬱 [IN’UTSU] - cheerless	Seal form i] ( 鬱 ) ; seal form ii] ( ) . Both occur as traditional forms. Analyses differ. The elements in 鬱 are: 林 79 ‘forest’, 缶 1141 (originally ‘lidded earthenware pot/jar’, now ‘tin, can’), 冖 ‘cover’, 鬯 ‘wine in vessel with fragrant herb added’, and 彡 115 ‘adorn’ etc. Instead of 林 , form ii] has ‘two hands’. Shuowen defines 鬱 as ‘luxuriant tree growth’, and according to Shirakawa, this referred originally to a special variety of wine with herbs, packed into jars. The Shuowen gives separate treatment to 鬱 and the similarly-shaped form ii]. The two graphs appear to have represented two homophonous words in early Chinese, one meaning ‘dense (forest)’ ( 鬱 ), and the other ‘fragrant herb’ (Schuessler). Shirakawa considers form ii] may have originally referred to a fragrant herb used in scented wine, but that form ii] and 鬱 then came to be used interchangeably. This reflects the view of traditional scholarship ( Kangxi zidian ). Mizukami, who gives what he regards as bronze equivalents for 鬱 and form ii], lists both with substantially overlapping meanings (core meaning: trees and other vegetation growing together in very close proximity), and treats ‘fragrant herb’ as a loan use of form ii]. The above variations in form together with differences in treatment of the component parts make this a challenging graph to analyze.

Another scholar (Katō) accounts as follows for the addition of 彡 115: originally written 景 494 (‘bright’), comprising 日 66 ‘sun’, with 京 110 (‘capital’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘light’; later, though, 光 129 (‘light’) became associated with the Yang principle (positive, strong, male), and 景 with the Yin principle (overcast, dark, negative, female), and at this point the determinative element 彡 (posited meanings vary considerably: ‘light, adorn’ [Ogawa], ‘feathery’ ([Qiu]) was added. The possibility of a semantic association of ‘shadow’ with ‘light’ (shadow cast by light on an object) is noted by Schuessler. SS1984:46; KJ1970:83; AS2007:576-7.

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 兌 (analyses include ‘open mouth with laughter, glad’ [Gu, Schuessler,], and ‘one who pleases the deities’ [Ogawa], ‘shaman’ [Katō]) as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘sharp, small and sharp’, giving ‘sharp edged tool/item’ (Ogawa, Katō), or – originally – ‘beard of wheat’ (Gu). The latter analysis gives ‘sharp’ as an extended sense, deriving from the fact that a beard of wheat is the bristly material surrounding the kernel, and also reminding us that the ancients were so much more closely in touch with nature than we are today.

Katō accounts for the sense ‘audience, meeting with someone of high status’ by noting that when seeking an audience, a request involved writing down the name of the audience-seeker, which was then presented to the person of high status, and this gave rise to ‘audience’ by association.

Note: meanings of 夗 / 夘 are ‘bend the body over’ (Katō), and ‘bend over/fall down’ (the latter is noted in Mizukami as an extended meaning).

OBI shows smoke from incense burner, taken by Ogawa as ‘produce smoke’; Mizukami takes as ‘smoke from incense burner covers and obscures things’, though the latter seems speculative. Seal form is taken as 火 ‘fire’, with 垔 as phonetic with associated sense ‘obstruct’, construed as ‘fire burns but air flow is blocked and fire smoulders’. Tōdō takes associated sense instead as ‘obscure, conceal’. In all of the above, ‘smoke’ represents a derived sense. OT1968:623; MS1995:v2:804-5; KJ1970:107.

The 6 th century Yupian gives 猨 as the orthodox form (main form) of this graph, and notes 猿 as a popular form. Later 猿 prevailed and is listed as the main form in Kangxi zidian . It has 犭 , the left-hand form of 犬 ‘dog’ 19 in compound graphs, but often used in a wider sense as ‘animal’, as here. In earlier form 猨 , 爰 1053 is both semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘pull, pull up’, thus ‘animal which pulls itself up (in trees), i.e. ‘monkey’. 袁 84 (‘long/flowing garment’) seems to have replaced 爰 purely for its phonetic function here.

Katō sees it as ‘white’, maintaining that in ancient times lead and tin (the latter a whitish alloy) were not well distinguished, thus the association between lead and white. However, Shuowen itself defines ‘lead’ and ‘tin’ contrastively, explaining 鉛 ‘lead’ as ‘a blue metal’, and NJK 錫 ‘tin’ as ‘a metal between silver and lead’.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and (‘boar’ or similar) as phonetic with associated sense ‘edge’, giving ‘edge of fabric’. Tōdō includes in word-family ‘fall down’, thus ‘hanging edge of fabric’, Shirakawa says ‘embroidered edge’. ‘Ties, relations’ are extended senses.

Has 欠 496, ‘open mouth, yawn; lack, be missing’ (‘bend over’ is another meaning’), with 區 282 (‘divide things up small’, small’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘vomit, disgorge’, giving ‘open mouth and vomit’ (Katō, Ogawa). Alternatively, Tōdō takes 欠 as ‘bend over’, giving ‘bend over and vomit’. In the early modern period, 歐 was employed for its sound value and despite – or because of – its negative sense (quite possibly a carry-over from the Edo period, or from earlier Chinese orthographic usage) to write 歐羅巴 Yōroppa ‘Europe’, a practice which has provided the basis for using 欧 today as a convenient one-graph writing in SJ compounds, meaning ‘Europe’. Modern form simplifies 區 to 区 , as in 282 (ward, section). MS1995:v1:700-1; OT1968:545; KJ1970:3.	SECTION OF EUROPE IS MISSING	images/Chapter7_img_62.jpg

Has 羽 82 ‘wing, feathers’, and 公 126 (‘public, fair’), sometimes taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘head, neck’, giving ‘bird’s neck/head feathers’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa). However, Shirakawa also notes that 翁 seems to have been used as a loan graph for ‘old man’ from Han times, echoed by Schuessler (‘old man; father’), who also links it to another near-homophone in early Chinese meaning ‘male of older generation, higher rank to whom respect is due’.

Has 宀 30 ‘roof, building’, and ( 釆 ’scatter seed’ over 廾 ‘two hands’), which has various interpretations. Katō takes it as phonetic with associated sense ‘warm under a covered interior’, but Tōdō rejects this approach, arguing it is semantic in function (‘scatter rice grains’), here meaning ‘things are stored under cover’. Shirakawa’s analysis is ‘place (under a roof) to offer up meat’. KJ1970:113; TA1965:227-30; SS1984:67. ‘Inside’ is now the main meaning. Take as 米 220 ‘rice’ under big roof, and 大 56 as ‘big’.

Shuowen heading has 月 209 ‘flesh/meat, body’, and 乙 1072 (‘knife’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear [Gu]); it notes the now standard form 臆 with 意 246 ‘thought’ as alternative; Tōdō takes 意 here as having associated sense ‘suppress’, giving ‘suppress bodily feelings’. Later used in extended senses such as ‘heart, mind, one’s thoughts’. ‘Timid, cowardly’ is Japanese-only usage. GY2008:1948; OT1968:828.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and NJK 奄 (‘cover’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Shirakawa suggests that the graph may represent what was originally a loanword from the northern regions. Mizukami analyzes 奄 based on bronze and seal forms as comprising 大 56 ‘big’ (but here meaning ‘cover from above’), with 申 338 ‘say’, here meaning ‘grow upwards’, giving ‘cover from above something growingupwards’.

Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ with (‘be sad/respectful when ritualistically hiding a deity’; see below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in ways which include i] ‘strike/trample, and collect’, giving ‘collect grain ears’ (Ogawa, Katō), and ii] ‘conceal’, giving ‘conceal collected grain (so as not to be prominent)’ (Tōdō). However, Shirakawa asserts there are no actual examples of usage of 穩 in the sense ‘trample and collect grain’, and rather the sense is always ‘quiet, tranquil’. In consequence, Shirakawa interprets the seal form of as two hands positioned beside (one above, one below) a receptacle used in a ritual to conceal a deity, beneath which 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ is positioned as semantic, giving ‘be respectful/sad’. In analyses i] and ii], ‘gentle’ is treated as a loan usage, while Shirakawa takes it as an extended sense. KJ1970:61-2; OT1968:737; TA1965:699-701; SS1984:69,34.

Tōdō includes 嫁 in a word-family meaning ‘cover something underneath’; this may be taken as in broad agreement with Katō’s analysis of the phonetic. Tōdō also regards 嫁 as representing a word probably derived from that underlying 家 , a view which is supported by Schuessler. OT1968:261; KJ1970:125; TA1965:381-3; AS2007:300-01.

Has 礻 723 ‘altar’ (by extension ‘deity’), and 咼 659 (‘distorted mouth’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘rebuke; displeased’ (Katō, Tōdō), or ii] ‘cruel death’ (Ogawa), both giving same overall sense ‘divine punishment’. KJ1970:311-2; TA1965:628; OT1968:725. Suggest take 咼 as topless tower.	TOPLESS TOWER HAS ALTAR BUT STILL A DISASTER	images/Chapter7_img_96.jpg
靴	KA, kutsu	shoe	L2	1085	13	製靴 [SEIKA] - shoemaking; 靴下 [kutsushita] - sock; 長靴 [nagagutsu] - boot	Seal ( 鞾 ) (included in a later version of Shuowen ); 靴 is a later version. 鞾 consists of 革 836 ‘leather’, and 華 1079 (originally, vegetation growing luxuriantly) as phonetic, to represent a foreign loanword into Chinese (Ogawa suggests from the language of the Xiongnu) which itself initially denoted long riding boots. In the graph 鞾 , the phonetic function of the right-hand element was later taken over by 化 258 ‘change’, quite possibly with a semantic connotation also. In Japanese usage at least, the sense became more generalized to ‘shoes, footwear’. OT1968:1094; GY2008:1545; SS1984:79.	CHANGE LEATHER INTO SHOE	images/Chapter7_img_97.jpg

Originally, used to count lengths of bamboo, then later the connotation ‘bamboo’ was dropped, and employed widely as a general counter. Often interchanged with the counter 個 695.

Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant’, and 家 89 (‘house’) as phonetic with associated sense as i] ‘good’, giving ‘grain which is well-developed’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘cover over’, giving ‘grain harvested and covered’ (Tōdō). The meaning ‘work to earn money’ is extended. OT1968:736; TA1965:383.	HOUSE FULL OF GRAIN INDICATES WORK AND MONEY EARNED	images/Chapter7_img_101.jpg

Seal form has ‘insect’ (general term), and 民 619 (‘people’) as phonetic purely for its onomatopoeic value to represent the sound of a mosquito buzzing in flight, and on the same basis 民 was later replaced by 文 72 ‘text’ with the double insect reduced to one, 虫 60. Several other variant shapes were also used historically, but need not concern us here. OT1968:885; SS1984:759; GY2008:1048-9.

Originally a pictograph; the simple shape is interpreted as a curved earthenware container or utensil, or a curved roof tile. ‘(Roof) tile’ tends to be taken as extended sense (Ogawa, Schuessler), though Shirakawa treats this as orig. meaning. Also used for ‘gram’ (in Japanese only). OT1968:663; TA1965:618; AS2007:222-3; SS1984:82.	FANCY CURVED TILE HAS A SPOT IN THE MIDDLE	images/Chapter7_img_106.jpg

Has 隹 324 ‘short-tailed bird, bird’, and 牙 1090 (‘tusk, interlocking pieces’ [here, five strokes]) as phonetic – purely onomatopoeic – denoting ‘crow, mountain crow’. 牙 stands to represent the characteristic cawing sound made by such birds. As Gu suggests, 雅 is no doubt a variant way of writing NJK 鴉 ‘crow’. At a later stage, 雅 was borrowed for its sound value to write another word meaning ‘elegant, refined’, now its main meaning.

Has 食 163 ‘food, eat’, and 我 833 (‘I/me’, originally ‘halberd’) as phonetic with associated sense taken variously as i] ‘wither’ (Katō), ii] ‘starve’ (Ogawa), or iii] ‘sharp, angular’ (Tōdō), but all giving essentially the same overall basic meaning, i.e. ‘withered/starving/angular body’, in other words ‘starving’.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind, feeling’, and 圣 (CO, ‘cultivate land, exert effort’, not as per right-hand part of 軽 287 etc; see below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘strange, unusual’ (Katō) or ‘caution’ (Ogawa), in either case giving ‘consider suspicious/strange’. Note that 圣 consists of 又 2003 ‘hand’, with 土 64 ‘earth/dirt’, giving ‘person digging’, thus ‘cultivate land, make efforts’. KJ1970:319; OT1968:363; MS1995:v1:262-3.

Has 忄 164 ‘feelings/heart’, and 每 225 (‘every’) as phonetic with associated senses taken as i] ‘regret’ (Katō), or ii] ‘dark’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘inauspicious’ (Ogawa). Overall negativity of the phonetic here confirms overall meaning is ‘regret’. KJ1970:316; MS1995:v1:528-9; TA1965:165; OT1968:367.	EVERY PERSON HAS FEELINGS OF REGRET	images/Chapter7_img_114.jpg

While both these seal forms are listed in Shuowen , it is 凷 that is accorded main heading status, with 塊 just noted as another equivalent shape. 凷 consists of 土 64 ‘earth’, and 凵 , which is originally a pictograph of a container, and this would give ‘basket for holding earth’, but one commentator takes 凵 here as having a phonetic role only (Katō). Alternatively, there may be the possibility that the earth in the basket was often made up of clods, giving ‘clod(s) of earth’ as an extended sense. As for 塊 , this consists of 土 , with 鬼 1179 (‘demon’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘round, round and hard’, giving ‘earth which is round (/ and hard)’ (Tōdō, Katō), or ii] ‘big’, giving ‘big earth [chunks]’ (Shirakawa).

楷	KAI	regular / model script	L1	1101	13	楷書 [KAISHO] - regular script; 楷行草 [KAIGYŌSŌ] - square, semi-cursive, cursive (script styles)	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 皆 1099 (‘all, everyone’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘harmony, order’ (Shirakawa). Originally referred to a type of tree, similar to a cypress; a tree which grew straight, reflected in the fact it produced wood suited to construction and the manufacture of wooden artefacts (Gu). Extended meanings include ‘straight, upright’ (figurative sense), and ‘model, rule’. It is this sense ‘model’ which was utilized to refer to a variety of Chinese script, the developmental stage known in Japanese as 楷書 kaisho , a term which is translated into English variously as ‘model script’, ‘regular script’, ‘block script’, and which is the basis of modern script use in the Chinese cultural sphere and in Japan.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, with 貴 847 (‘precious’) as phonetic, with associated sense ‘be destroyed’. Shuowen glosses 潰 as meaning ‘leak’; then to connote destructive water force such as dyke or similar bursting. Later, generalized to ‘be destroyed/defeated’.

Has 土 64 ‘earth/soil’, and 褱 (see below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘crumble; destroy’, giving ‘earthen wall of fortress/house, etc. is damaged/destroyed’ (Mizukami, Katō); Ogawa takes more generally as ‘earth crumbles’. Later generalized to ‘destroy/be destroyed’. Note: CO 褱 has 衣 444 ‘garment/clothes’, with second element (middle part of 褱 ) which is taken either i] as meaning ‘shed tears’, thus ‘shed tears and conceal in one’s clothing’, or ii] as phonetic with associated sense ‘keep, retain’, thus ‘keep (something) within one’s clothing’, and by extension ‘conceal in one’s bosom’ or ‘ embrace’; both analyses are listed by Mizukami.

Has 力 78 ‘strength, effort’, and 亥 875 (NJK, ‘wild animal’, probably a boar or pig, but the OBI pictograph too simple to interpret definitively) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘investigate, pursue’, giving ‘vigorously pursue, thoroughly judge (a criminal)’.

Has 山 26 ‘hill, mountain’, and 厓 , itself already an independent graph (NJK) also meaning ‘cliff, precipice’; Ogawa and Tōdō consider that the element 圭 1076 (‘ceremonial jade’) also has a function in 崖 as phonetic with associated sense ‘sloping’. TA1965:504-08; OT1968:304,149. Suggest taking 圭 as ‘double’ the ground 土 64 with 厂 as cliff.	IN MOUNTAINS, CLIMBING A CLIFF IS LIKE DOUBLE THE GROUND	images/Chapter7_img_127.jpg

Has 忄 ‘heart, mind’ 164, and 旣 / 既 / 既 1177 (‘already’, q.v.) (originally, ‘eat completely, eat one’s fill’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as ‘be blocked’, giving ‘one’s heart is blocked/stifled, lament’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or as ‘enraged and arrogant’, giving ‘be enraged’ (Katō). In the latter analysis, ‘lament’ is presumably to be seen as a loan usage. OT1968:383,458; TA1965:702-06; KJ1970:153.	ALREADY HAVE FEELINGS OF LAMENT	images/Chapter7_img_129.jpg

Has 言 118 ‘words; say’, and 亥 875 (‘wild animal’) as phonetic with associated sense taken variously as i] ‘all’, thus ‘all take an oath’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘bundle, something bound; agreement’, giving original sense ‘(temporary) agreement (in wartime)’ (Katō), or iii] ‘words made tight’, also giving ‘agreement’ (Tōdō; in his word-family ‘make taut, tighten’); Gu, however, takes as ‘carve, inscribe’, thus ‘words carved’, suggesting content of some importance. ‘Relevant, the said …’ may be a loan usage.

Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, with 既 / 旣 1177 (originally, ‘eat completely, eat one’s fill’; now ‘already’,) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rub/rub across, make level’, giving ‘length of wood for levelling off’, used for removing excess from top of container for measuring rice (or similar). This was an approximate measure, not precise, so it acquired the extended sense ‘generally, in broad measure’. OT1968:518; KJ1970:152-3; TA1965:706.

Has 骨 877 ‘bones’ and 亥 875, a graph typically taken as ‘wild animal (probably pig or boar)’. Shirakawa interprets as its carcasse. It came to denote a skeleton or bones in general, not just of a wild animal. Schuessler suggests a possible link between the word represented by 骸 and that represented by 核 1116 ‘nucleus, core’.

Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 亥 875 (‘wild animal’ [probably a pig or boar]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘enclose’, giving – in one analysis – ‘box/crate made of wood/tree bark’; later borrowed for ‘stone, kernel’. Another interpretation, found in Erya , a very early Chinese encyclopaedic dictionary, takes it as hard casings on a tree, i.e. treats the original meaning as ‘stone (of peach, etc.), kernel’.

Has 邑 376 ‘inhabited place, village’ in its common form 阝 as right-hand element, and 享 1218 ‘receive, keep’ in its original sense ‘fortified city walls’. 享 in the sense ‘fortified city walls’ is taken as an abbreviation of a more complex older graph (Katō, Qiu). Overall resultant meaning is ‘enclosed fortified area’ (included in Tōdō’s word-family ‘framework/enclose with a framework’), generalized to ‘enclosure, quarters’.

Has 犭 ‘dog’ 19, and ‘catch bird’ 468 (originally, crested bird, with 又 2003 ‘hand’) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘catch wild prey using dogs (in hunting)’; the graph suggests the prey was originally just birds. Shirakawa lists bronze forms and several OBI forms as predecessors of 獲 (Ma also lists OBI); all lack 犭/犬 as determinative. KJ1970:328; MS1995:v2:1118-9; OT1968:648; MR2007:421.

The older form 挂 has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 圭 461 (originally, ‘demarcating path between fields’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hang, suspend’, thus ‘hang, suspend’. 掛 is considered to be a popular equivalent. The alternative element NJK 卦 (‘indicate response of the gods through divination’) as phonetic has associated sense ‘link up’ (Katō). KJ1970:323,137-8; OT1968:417; DJ2009:v3:1001; SS1984:77. Suggest taking 卦 as 圭 double ‘earth’ 土 64 and ト as a ‘crack’ (see 96 外 ).	CRACKED HAND IS CONNECTED WITH DOUBLE LOADS OF EARTH	images/Chapter7_img_150.jpg

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 舌 755 ‘tongue’, but note that 舌 is a later regularized shape for what at the seal script stage was something different, interpreted by Katō and Tōdō as meaning ‘close the mouth’. The element just described, functioning here as semantic and phonetic (with sense generalized to ‘close’) then combines with 手 to give ‘close with the hands’, and hence ‘fasten, bind’.

喝	KATSU	shout, scold	L1	1129	11	喝さい [KASSAI] - applause; 恐喝 [KYŌKATSU] - threat; 一喝 [IKKATSU] - yell, roar	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 曷 as right-hand element. Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and 曷 as semantic and phonetic (‘question loudly/stop and question’; see 謁 1048), giving ‘shout loudly’, and – as a consequence – ‘throat becomes dry’, to give ‘become hoarse’ (the Shuowen explanation of 喝 is ‘throat becomes dry’). The additional Japanese meaning ‘scold, rebuke’ may be seen as an extended meaning. GY2008:1336; DJ2009: v1:119. As with 1048, we suggest taking the top 10 right hand part 曰/日 as ‘day’ 66, 匕 as slumped/sitting person, with 勹 as corner.

Has 艹 53 ‘plant’, and / 曷 (‘question loudly/stop and question’; see 謁 1048) as phonetic with associated sense ‘be bent, twisted’, giving ‘plant with tortuously twisted stem’, i.e. a type of vine. For this graph the traditional form is standard. GY2008:1376; MS1995:v2:1122-4. As with 1048, we suggest taking right hand part 曰/日 as ‘day’ 66, 匕 as slumped/sitting person, with 勹 as corner.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 骨 877 (‘bone’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘emerge’ (Katō) or ii] ‘smooth’ (Shirakawa), both giving ‘water emerges easily’, and hence ‘slide; smooth’. Alternatively, there is another variation on interpretation of the phonetic, i.e. iii] ‘revolve, go round’, taken as ‘go round smoothly’, and hence again ‘smooth’ (Ogawa).

Has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and / 曷 (‘stop and question/question loudly’; see 謁 1048), taken as phonetic by several scholars (Shirakawa, Ogawa; sense not specified), but it may alternatively serve here as an abbreviation of 葛 1131 ‘vine’, giving original meaning ‘garment made of coarse fiber’ – a sense which the above scholars also agree with. The meaning ‘brown’ is an extended sense based on the color of such garments. GY2008:1766; SS1984:115; OT1968:907. As with 1048, we suggest taking right hand part 曰/日 as day 66, 匕 as slumped/sitting person, with 勹 as corner.

且	ka	furthermore, besides, and	L1	1135	5	且又 [katsumata] - moreover; 尚且 [naokatsu] - and yet; こう且 [KŌSHO] - for a while	OBI ; bronze ; seal . Considered to be based on a pictograph, but interpretations vary regarding exactly what is depicted. One view takes as meat in a tiered vessel, as an offering (Ogawa); another takes as tomb with multiple layers of earth piled up in a mound (Katō). Alternatively, 且 is seen by others as layers of meat on a chopping-board (or stand), as the original way of writing NJK 俎 ‘chopping-board’ (Shirakawa, Tōdō, Gu). Given the shape of many of the OBI forms (Mizukami gives several dozen), however, yet another interpretation deserves serious consideration, i.e. that the graph originally depicted a phallus, and by extension was used for what was later written 祖 758 ‘ancestor’ (Gu, Karlgren). Originally a picto-graph, 且 was borrowed at an early stage as a convenient way of writing several other words or grammatical elements with more abstract senses, including ‘moreover’, hence its meaning in Japanese today.

Seal form is listed in Shuowen , but only as an alternative way of writing another, more complex graph also meaning ‘cauldron, big cooking pot’. 釜 has 金 16 ‘metal’, with 父 216 (‘father’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘big’ (Mizukami) or ‘swell up’ (Ogawa).

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 兼 1281 (now ‘combine’, but originally showing hand holding two ‘grain plants’: see 87) as phonetic with associated sense ‘curved and sharp’, giving ‘sickle’, and possibly also having a semantic relevance.

Has 氵 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 干 840 (‘weapon; dry’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘come out to excess, pour out all over the place’, giving ‘sweat’. It does seem somewhat ironic to have a character normally meaning ‘dry’ to express ‘pour out’, and it may be better to think of it in its earlier meaning as ‘weapon’.

Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat’, and 干 840 (‘dry’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘base, foundation’ (Ogawa), giving ‘bodily part which is essential’; Shirakawa seems to support this interpretation. Katō, alternatively, looks to take the associated sense as ‘dwarf bamboo’, on the basis of the tubular shape of the blood vessels linked to the liver, giving ‘bodily part with blood vessels shaped like dwarf bamboo stems’. In the former analysis, the meaning is perhaps somewhat vague. OT1968:816; SS1984:118; KJ1970:204.	DRIED MEAT TURNS OUT TO BE LIVER	images/Chapter7_img_170.jpg
冠	KAN, kanmuri	crown	L1	1143	9	王冠 [ŌKAN] - royal crown; 栄冠 [EIKAN] - laurels; 冠毛 [KANMŌ] - crest, plume	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Typically analyzed as 冖 ‘cover, and 寸 920 ‘hand, measure’, and 元 117 (‘origin, source’) as semantic and phonetic in its original sense ‘head’, giving ‘put on a cap’, and by extension ‘cap’; Katō has a view that differs somewhat, taking the associated sense of 元 here as ‘tie/bind the hair’, though he arrives at essentially the same overall meaning for the graph.

The OBI form of CO 臽 has the figure of a person over a hole, meaning ‘pit, hole’; and at the seal stage 阜/阝 1907 ‘hill, terraced slope’ was added on the left side, giving overall sense ‘elevated land caves in’ (Ogawa), or ‘get trapped, fall in’ (Schuessler). DJ2009:v3:1185; OT1968:1067; AS2007:530. A separate vertical stroke appears to have found its way into the modern graph, namely 旧 .

乾	KAN, kawaku	dry	L2	1145	11	乾電池 [KANDENCHI] - dry battery; 乾燥機 [KANSŌKI] - (tumble) drier; 乾季 [KANKI] - dry season	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations vary considerably. Ogawa takes it simply as a variant of CO 倝 (original meaning ‘sunrise’ [see 幹 667]), which he interprets as ‘flagpole’, a point on which Shirakawa is in basic agreement, though he takes 乙 1072 here as ‘banner’. Gu, alternatively, sees it as showing a plant breaking out upwards through the surface of the ground. Katō does not favour the ‘plant’ interpretation, and instead takes 乙 as meaning ‘twisted, bent’ (though commentators disagree on what precisely 乙 originally represented, there is substantial support for a core meaning ‘curved’; see 1072), and 倝 / (‘sun shines high in the sky’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘strong, which Katō then takes as giving an overall sense ‘something bent straightens out’. Yet another analysis – probably the best – is provided by Tōdō, who takes 乙 as ‘twisting’, and as ‘sun rises up’ (the bronze and seal forms of 倝 / include the element 日 ‘sun’ 66), giving overall sense ‘air rises up in meandering fashion’ for 乾 . As for the meaning ‘dry’ for 乾 , Tōdō sees this as semantically related to his interpretation of the original meaning of that graph; both senses are included in his word-family ‘rise up’. DJ2009:v3:1200; OT1968:28; SS1984:123; GY2008:1198; KJ1970:102-3; MS1995:v1:70-71; TA1965:587; AS2007:249. Suggest taking 乙 as ‘bent’,  as ‘person’, and as ‘sun rising (through plants)’.

Has 土 64 ‘ground’, and 甚 1552 (now ‘extreme’, originally ‘sexual relations’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stick out’, giving ‘ground which sticks out’, ‘raised ground’. The later sense ‘endure’ now predominates for this graph, Katō suggesting it is a borrowed meaning based on connection with 勘 1146, the early meaning of which was also ‘endure’. The fact that 堪 and 勘 represented near-homophones in early Chinese supports this view. KJ1970:208-9; MS1995:v2:866-7; AS2007:330-31; OT1968:219.

In latter view ‘exchange’ is presumably loan usage or extended sense (Tōdō considers to be the latter). KJ1970:332-3; SS1984:120,125; TA1965:630. Take 勹 as bent figure, thighs, 大 56 ‘big’.

款	KAN	friendship, clause, engrave	L1	1154	12	借款 [SHAKKAN] - loan, credit; 落款 [RAKKAN] - signature; 款待 [KANTAI] - hospitality	Seal forms , . This graph has several alternative shapes, mostly involving variation on the left-hand side (e.g. 欵 ), with 欠 496 (initially, pictograph of person with mouth open wide; now meaning ‘lack’). In addition, Gu lists one form that he treats as the OBI predecessor, consisting of left-hand 柰 (NJK, originally‘firewood on altar’, now meaning ‘what?’), with right-hand 又 ‘hand’ 2003, signifying a ritualistic request to the gods to be granted good fortune. Based on the seal forms, several other commentators (Katō, Ogawa) also take the core meaning of this graph/graph group as involving some sort of wish (still a meaning in Chinese). Regarding variation in shape, it is worth observing that Shuowen notes 款 written with 柰 on the left-hand side as an alternative form: it may well be that an original 木 as top left-hand element in one form of this graph later became corrupted to 士 (Ogawa takes this view). Katō analyzes 款 on the basis of the seal form in Shuowen as 欠 in its early sense ‘(mouth) wide open’, with a left-hand element 祟 (NJK ‘curse’, meaning given in Shuowen as ‘calamity initiated by the gods’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pit, cavity, void’, giving ‘what a person longs for’. Through association with ‘cavity, void’, Katō then takes ‘engrave’ (as in the case of inscriptions traditionally on artefacts such as bronze bells and vessels) as an extended sense. Other meanings such as ‘friendship’ and ‘clause’ are perhaps best seen as loan usages. GY2008:1365,1163; KJ1970:305; OT1968:533; DJ2009:v2:704,v1:11; AS2007:338. We suggest taking this awkward graph as 士 521 ‘samurai’, 示 723 ‘show’, and 欠 496 ‘lack’, fortunately having an easier mnemonic.

Has 門 231 ‘gate’, and 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, giving original sense ‘timber for closing gate, bar on gate’; ‘obstruct’ and ‘defend’ evolved as extended senses. Use of 閑 in the sense ‘leisure’ may have been a loan usage for an early Chinese word of that meaning which was homophonous with the word meaning ‘bar on gate’.

Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents also. MS1995:v2:860-61; OT1968:661; KJ1970:329. As with 1162, we again suggest taking as variant of 哀 1008 ‘pity, sorrow’, and ‘eye’ 目 76 as ‘look’.

韓	KAN	Korea, S. Korea	L1	1164	18	韓国 [KANKOKU] - South Korea; 韓国人 [KANKOKUJIN] - S.Koreans; 日韓 [NIKKAN] - Japan-S.Korea	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 韋 446 (originally, ‘go in different directions’ or ‘move away from’, q.v.), and 倝 667 ( in 韓 is abbreviation; sense disputed: ‘sun shines high in sky’ [Mizukami, Tōdō] or ‘flagpole with banner’ [Shirakawa]) as phonetic; initial overall sense unclear (see Note). According to Shirakawa, 韓 has always served to denote a proper noun; early use was as name of ancient state in Warring States period China (ca. 403-221BC). ‘South Korea’ is the modern meaning. Note: Shuowen defines meaning of 韓 as ‘(water) well surround’, but Shirakawa sees this as loan usage, and tentatively takes original meaning as ‘ornate halberd with leather grip’. MS1995:v1:70-71; SS1984:132,127; TA1965:587; DJ2009:v2:445. Take 韋 as ‘differ’, as 日 66 ‘sun’ rising through ‘plants’ 艹 .

Has 監 1159 (originally ‘water mirror’, now ‘watch,’), and 金 16 ‘metal’ added later to denote ‘metal mirror’ (in early China, typically made of bronze – see 鏡 486). Other meanings for 鑑 such as ‘pattern, appreciate’ which evolved later may be seen as extended senses. SS1984:134; TA1965:846; OT1968:1052; AS2007:305.

Has 玉 15 ‘jade, jewel’, and 元 117 (‘origin, source’, initially ‘large head’) as phonetic. Associated sense is taken variously as ‘cup the hands’ (Tōdō), ‘pick up’ (Gu), ‘offer up in the hands’ (Shirakawa), ‘throw (something) down/roll (something) over’ (Ogawa), but the consensus regarding the original core meaning of the graph (except Ogawa) may be summarised as ‘take a piece of jade in the hands’. ‘Appreciate’, which appears to be an early extended sense, is now just a minor sense. It is not clear whether ‘play’ is a loan usage or an extended sense; Gu takes as the latter. TA1965:611-19; SS1984:136; OT1968:655; GY2008:542.

Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 元 117 (initially showing person with large head, giving ‘head’ as early meaning; now ‘origin, beginning’) taken as i] as phonetic with associated sense as ‘not easily controlled’, and hence ‘stubborn’ (Shirakawa), or ii] as both semantic (‘crown of the head’, and hence ‘protuberance’) and phonetic, meaning ‘wood knot difficult to cut out’, and by extension ‘stupid, stubborn’ (Gu).

Has 亻 41 person’, and 支 (717 ‘branch, support’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘deed, skill’, giving overall sense ‘person who has skills/performs’, and hence ‘actor’ (Ogawa, Tōdō); Tōdō regards original sense as ‘person who knows handicrafts’.

Katō, by contrast, takes ‘small’ as the associated phonetic sense of 其 , giving ‘game board pieces’ as the direct (not extended) meaning. See also 碁 1314.

Comprises 亻 41 person, and 爲 1017 (‘do; purpose’), the latter typically taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘change appearance’, giving ‘someone changes appearance/changes into someone else’ (with negative connotation), and hence ‘deceive; false’. Ogawa – perhaps less convincingly – takes 爲 / 為 differently as having a semantic role here, giving ‘person does’, and ‘deceit’ as an extended sense. KJ1970:19; TA1965:607-10; OT1968:73.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 疑 848 (‘doubt’) taken in one analysis as phonetic with associated senses ‘doubtful’ or ‘resemble’, the latter giving ‘make something to resemble by hand’, and hence ‘imitate’ (Katō). Another analysis takes 疑 as both semantic and phonetic, again giving the overall sense ‘imitate’ (Ogawa). KJ1970:248-9; OT1968:432.	MAKE DOUBTFUL IMITATION BY HAND	images/Chapter7_img_237.jpg

Has 牛 108 ‘cow, ox’, and 義 674 (later meaning: ‘righteous’), which may be taken as both semantic and phonetic in function; the original meaning of 義 , which includes 我 833 (originally ‘halberd’, now ‘I, self’) is ‘animal sacrifice’. This then leads to an overall sense ‘ox sacrifice’, or more generally ‘animal sacrifice’ for 犠 (Ogawa, Tōdō, Shirakawa). A divergent view is offered by Katō, who maintains that 義 serves here as phonetic only, originally with an associated sense ‘young male (ox)’, which for sacrificial purposes was of a single color, and ‘single color’ subsequently came to predominate as the new associated sense, giving the overall sense ‘young ox of a single color’; in this interpretation, ‘sacrifice’ is an extended sense.

Has 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation’, and CO 匊 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘having shrivelled leaves’, giving ‘plant with shrivelled leaves’ (Katō), or ii] ‘round’, giving ‘plant with round [head/flower]’, i.e. ‘chrysanthemum’ (Ogawa). However, both Katō and Shirakawa maintain that in ancient times this graph did not refer to the chrysanthemum/an autumn-flowering plant; according to Shirakawa, originally it referred instead to a different flowering plant called Wild Pink or Large Pink ( Dianthus superbus ). Note: 匊 comprises 勹 (see 611), a determinative originally depicting the side view of a person bending over with arms lowered, signifying ‘embrace, enclose’, with 米 220 ‘rice’ (here has more the sense ‘scattered grains’), giving ‘enclose within the hand(s), and by extension ‘scoop up’.

Has 口 22 ‘mouth, say’, and 契 1258 (originally, ‘mark with knife, engrave’; now means ‘pledge, join’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘chew’, to give ‘eat by chewing, eat’; ‘receive’ is an extended minor sense. KJ1970:258; OT1968:188; SS1984:168. We suggest breaking down this graph into 大 56 ‘big’, 口 22 ‘mouth’, 刀 198 ‘sword’, and as variant of 主 315 ‘master’.

Originally, 卩 41 ‘person kneeling’, with (see Note below; not to be confused with similar-shaped 谷 135 ‘valley’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘retreat, withdraw’, giving original sense ‘withdraw on one’s knees (from presence of a superior)’, then generalized to just ‘withdraw’. Whether by design or in error, left-hand was later replaced by 去 276 ‘go, leave’. ‘On the contrary’ (i.e. the opposite of what might be expected) may be regarded as an extended sense. Note: Katō takes 卻 to mean ‘roof of the mouth’, but Tōdō takes as ‘bend at back of knee’; in either case, refers to an inwardly-curving – i.e. concave – part of the body.

This graph was originally written 鼻 399 ‘nose’, with 臭 1452 ‘smell, odor’, giving overall meaning ‘smell’ (verb), this being based on dogs being well-known for their keen sense of smell. Subsequently (Six Dynasties period [220-589AD] onwards), 口 22 ‘mouth’ was sometimes used as determinative in place of 鼻 , giving 嗅 , which has come to predominate. In standard modern Japanese usage, the semantically transparent component 犬 19 ‘dog’ here has been retained, but note that in 臭 1452 ‘smell, odor’ when used as an independent graph, standard usage still favors the semantically opaque 大 56 ‘big’ as lower element due to earlier script simplification. SS1984:177; GY2008:1082; OT1968:192. We suggest taking the elements as 自 150, which is now used to mean ‘self’ but was originally a nose, with ‘big spotted dog’ 犬 19, plus ‘mouth’ 口 22.

Has 穴 860 ‘cave, hole’, and NJK 躳 ‘body’; at the clerical script stage, we find 躬 as an alternative form (also NJK), and this latter appears to have later gained ascendancy over 躳 . One analysis takes 躳 / 躬 as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend the body over’, giving ‘bend over and enter deep into (a cave)’ (Tōdō, Ogawa); by extension, ‘be in difficulties/an extreme situation’. Katō takes the associated sense of 躬 / 躳 as ‘extreme’, to give ‘innermost part of cave dwelling’. Note: 躳 is 身 339 ‘body’, with NJK 呂 ‘backbone, spine’ (originally pictograph).

We suggest taking the elements as 穴 860 ‘hole’, and further taking the elements of 躬 into 身 339 (still with a meaning of ‘body’) and 弓 as ‘bow’ 107.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, with CO 豦 as phonetic with associated sense ‘rest on, hold onto’, thus ‘hold onto with the hands’, and by extension ‘rely on’. Note: 豦 is typically interpreted as depicting a tiger ( 虍 1301) and boar or wild pig ( 豕 89) fighting each other. The right-hand part of the modern form is based on a cursive style which is the same shape as 処 (907 ‘deal with’). SS1984:180; TA1965:385; MS1995:v2:1222-4; KJ1970:268; GY2008:1582; ZY2009:v2:435.

Has , a minor variation of early form of 丘 1203 ‘hillock’, and 虍 1301 (‘tiger’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘big’, thus ‘big hill’. Based on early forms of 丘 , Tōdō takes to show hillocks around a central depression or basin, thus giving ‘empty’ as extended sense. Ogawa, however, treats ‘empty’ as loan usage. OT1968:881; TA1965:398-400; MS1995:v1:7-8. Suggest as variant of 並 977 ‘line up’.

Typically analyzed as 凵 ‘open container, open mouth’, and inner element (seal form) or メ as phonetic with associated sense ‘empty’, giving ‘mouth is empty’, and by extension ‘bad, misfortune’. An alternative interpretation takes 凵 as representing a hole in the ground, and as a person stuck in it, again leading to ‘bad’ as an extended sense (this view noted in Mizukami).

Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and 丩 898 (‘intertwine’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘loud’ (Ogawa) or ‘suddenly’ (Katō). The 17 th century Zhengzitong dictionary treats 叫 as a simplified version of 嘂 , a graph listed in Shuowen and explained as ‘call out loud’. Note: in standard Japanese usage, 丩 is three strokes, not two. DJ2009:v1:119,179; MS1995:v1:12-13; KJ1970:358; OT1968:165. Suggest 丩 as pitchfork.

狂	KYŌ, kuru	lunatic, mad	L1	1217	7	狂人 [KYŌJIN] - lunatic; 狂言 [KYŌGEN (dramatic)] - farce; 狂った [kurutta] - mad, insane	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 犭 19 ‘dog’, and element (modified from the clerical script stage onwards to 王 ) as phonetic with the associated sense taken either as i] ‘walk/move around randomly’ (Tōdō), or ii] ‘become twisted’ (Ogawa), ‘insane’ (Katō [Ogawa also, as extended sense]), either way giving ‘uncontrollable dog’, and by extension ‘dog goes out of control’, then ‘dog’ was dropped to give generalized ‘go wild/insane’. Tōdō’s view is based on taking the right-hand element as originally corresponding to the same element in 往 652 ‘go’, on which Qiu is in agreement. TA1965:415; OT1968:640; QX2000:253; KJ1970:270-71. Suggest taking right-hand element simply as 王 5 ‘king’.	THE KING IS A MAD DOG!	images/Chapter7_img_277.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_278.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_279.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 兄 114 (‘elder brother’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cold’, thus giving ‘cold water’. The abstract meanings such as ‘situation’ and ‘all the more’ are loan usages.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and NJK 夾 (‘put between’, ‘under the arms’, see 1220) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘put between, insert’.OT1968:414; SS1984:193; TA1965:862. We suggest taking the right hand element as 夫 601 ‘man, husband,’ and 丷 as ‘away’ 70.	MAN SQUEEZED BY HAND CAN’T GET AWAY	images/Chapter7_img_283.jpg
狭	KYŌ, sema	narrow, small	L2	1222	9	狭義 [KYŌGI] - narrow meaning; 広狭 [KŌKYŌ] - extent, area; 狭苦しい [semakurushii] - cramped	Seal ( 陜 ) . 狹 with 犭 19 ‘dog’ is an error for earlier 陜 with 阝 ‘hill, terraced slope’ 1907. Qiu states this occurred at an early stage. 夾 (‘hold under arms’, see 1220) is phonetic with associated sense ‘held between on both sides’, giving ‘blocked on both sides by hills/mountains’; hence, ‘narrow valley’, then generalized to ‘narrow, small’. KJ1970:174; QX2000:267. Take right hand element as ‘man’ 夫 603 and 丷 as ‘away’ 70.	SMALL MAN NARROWLY GETS AWAY FROM DOG	images/Chapter7_img_284.jpg
恐	KYŌ, oso	fear, awe	L2	1223	10	恐怖 [KYŌFU] - fear; 恐英病 [KYŌEIBYŌ] - Anglophobia; 恐れ入る [osoreiru] - be awed, sorry	Seal . Has 心 164 ‘heart, feeling’, and 巩 as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘pierce’, thus ‘feeling as if heart is pierced’, and ‘be afraid’ as extended sense (Mizukami), or ii] ‘empty’, thus ‘feel empty as if a hole in the heart’, again giving ‘be afraid’ as extended sense (Tōdō), or iii] ‘fearful’, thus ‘be afraid’ (Ogawa). Note: 巩 is 丮 ‘hold out hands’ 905, with 工 125 as phonetic with associated sense ‘embrace’, thus ‘embrace with hands’. KJ1970:277; MS1995:v1:504-6; TA1965:306; OT1968:368; KJ1970:277. Take 工 ‘work’ and 凡 as desk.	WORK AT DESK GIVES FEELING OF FEAR	images/Chapter7_img_285.jpg
恭	KYŌ, uyauya	respectful	L1	1224	10	恭順 [KYŌJUN] - obedience; 恭敬 [KYŌKEI] - respect; 恭謙 [KYŌKEN] - deference		WHEN TOGETHER, FEELINGS SHOULD BE RESPECTFUL

Has 月 209 ‘flesh, meat, body’, and 劦 (three bulging arms [see 力 78], giving ‘combined strength’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘side (of the chest)’ (Katō says ‘that which is between the elbows’), thus ‘side of the chest’; ‘threaten’ is a loan usage.

矯	KYŌ, ta	straighten, falsify	L1	1226	17	矯正的 [KYŌSEITEKI] - corrective; 奇矯 [KIKYŌ] - eccentricity; 矯め直す [tamenaosu] - correct	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 矢 145 ‘arrow’, and NJK 喬 277 (now ‘high’, originally building with curved upper structure, q.v.) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘curved, bent’, thus ‘bent arrow’, and ‘falsify’ as an extended sense. Since a bent arrow needed straightening to fly true, over time ‘straighten’ evolved as a second extended sense, and this has come to be the main meaning. Note: bronze forms of 喬 consist of 高 132 (‘high’; originally tall structure, such as watchtower), with curved stroke(s) signifying ‘curved’. That is, both mean ‘high’ now. MS1995:v1:236-7; KJ1970:274-5; SS1984:200; TA1965:263. We suggest remembering in association with 橋 277 ‘bridge’.	STRAIGHTEN ARROW BENT LIKE ARCHED BRIDGE	images/Chapter7_img_289.jpg

Has 音 6 ‘sound’, and 鄕 ( 郷 ) (‘village, rural’ 852) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘air moves’ (Tōdō), or ii] ‘spread outwards’ (Ogawa), giving ‘sound which moves/spreads out’. Katō takes 郷 itself as ‘spreading sound’. TA1965:401-03; OT1968:1100; KJ1985:660.	SOUND OF VILLAGE FEAST ECHOES	images/Chapter7_img_290.jpg

Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, and 敬 856 (‘respect’) as phonetic, taken in one view with associated sense ‘brace/tense the body’, thus ‘horse is startled’; later generalized to ‘be startled/surprised’. Shirakawa, however, interprets 敬 as ‘hit to admonish someone making spell-like prayer’, with 馬 added, he suggests, as an animal easily startled. The former view seems more persuasive.

仰	GYŌ, KŌ, ao	look up, respect, state	L1	1229	6	仰天 [GYŌTEN] - amazement; 信仰 [SHINKŌ] - creed, faith; 仰々しい [GYŌGYŌshii] - grandiose	Seal ( 卬 ) ; seal ( 仰 ) . Older graph 卬 is analyzed as ‘person kneeling’ 卩 41 in front of someone standing (Mizukami takes as ‘person standing up tall’), giving ‘look up at and greet (an arriving guest)’. Later graph 仰 has additional ‘person’ element ( 亻 41); this is believed not to represent an extra third person, but a way to distinguish it from another similar character ( 迎 1273 ‘greet’).

Has 日 66 ‘sun’, with CO 堯 (‘tall person’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘become bright, white’, giving ‘light of the sun becomes clear’, i.e. ‘dawn’. 堯 may well also lend a semantic element in the idea of tall, indicating rising high. Dawn is also an event. Note: 堯 consists of 垚 ‘earth piled up high’, with 兀 ‘person with head above others’, giving ‘tall person’, and by extension ‘outstanding person’. OT1968:470; KJ1970:282; TA1965:266; MS1995:v1:274-5. See also 焼 539 ‘burn’, which we suggest taking by association to remember 1230.

The seal equivalent of 凝 is included in Shuowen , but not as a main heading, only as an alternative form for 冰 ‘ice’ in popular usage. 凝 has 冫 401 ‘ice’ (originally, pictograph of cracks or irregularities in ice), and 疑 848 (originally ‘child stands unsteadily’, now ‘doubt’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘remain still’, giving ‘ice forms and stays still’. By extension, ‘stiff; engrossed, fixed’. ‘Elaborate’ may relate to patterns of ice-cracks. DJ2009:v3:935; KJ1970:248; OT1968:106.	DOUBT ICE IS STIFF	images/Chapter7_img_294.jpg

Has 艹 53 ‘plant’, with 囷 (‘round granary’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘shady and damp’, thus ‘blotch-like growth in damp, shady places’ (Katō), or ii] ‘crowded’, thus ‘crowded plant growth’ (Shirakawa). In Shuowen , 菌 is defined as ‘mushroom’; ‘fungus, bacterium’ are extended sense. Note: CO 囷 (‘granary’) is 囗 84 ‘enclosure’, with 禾 ‘grain’ 87. QX2000:193; KJ1970:295; SS1984:208-9.

Seal form, which lacks , the bottom two strokes of 琴 , shows body (bridge) and strings of a koto (Oriental harp) stood upright. At the clerical script stage, the lower element 人 changed to 今 138 (‘now’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘enclose in box shape, enclose’, thus ‘box-shape musical instrument with strings’, i.e. koto . Ogawa, however, takes associated sense to be ‘sound’. Mizukami and Ogawa take the keyhole-shaped element in seal form, corresponding to 人 in 琴 as abbreviation of later 今 , as phonetic. MS1995:v2:854-5; KJ1970:243; SS1984:210; OT1968:658. Take 王 as ‘king’ 5.	NOW TWO KINGS PLAY THE KOTO	images/Chapter7_img_300.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_301.jpg

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with CO (‘burning human sacrifice’ as rain-making ritual or ‘burning of drought god effigy’ [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘a little, scant’, thus ‘person of meagre talents’; later generalized to ‘meagre, a little’. Note: OBI ancestral form of has ‘fire’ as bottom element, though less clear in bronze, then erroneously changed to 土 ‘earth’ 64 in seal. TA1965:695-8; SS1984:210; GY2008:1186; WB1994:162; OT1968:217; MS1995:v1:270-71. Take as ‘odd’ master 主 315, ‘eye’ 目 76, ‘grass’ 艹 53.

緊	KIN	tight, compact, tense	L1	1237	15	緊張 [KINCHŌ] - tension; 緊急 [KINKYŪ] - crisis; 緊密 [KINMITSU] - compactness	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 糸 29 ‘thread/string’, and NJK 臤 (now means ‘hard, wise’, but bronze form originally depicted a hand [ 又 2003] pulling out an eyeball [ 臣 543, now meaning ‘minister’]) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘pull straight’, to give ‘pull strings/thread straight’ (Gu), ‘pull strings/thread tight’ (Ogawa), or ‘bind tight’ (Schuessler). ‘Tense’ is an extended sense. Note: Shirakawa, who similarly gives the meaning of 臤 as ‘to destroy an eyeball’, believes it was made part of a sacrificial ritual when something important was being sought from the deities. GY2008: 1036,605; OT1968:785; SS1984:212; AS2007:315. We suggest taking the components literally, though gruesome.

Has NJK 帛 ‘white silk, silk cloth’, with 金 16 ‘gold’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘silk fabric with gold color’. Tōdō, following an explanation in the Shiming dictionary of ca. 200AD, treats 錦 as indicating this type of fabric is the most valuable, just as 金 ‘gold’ is the most valuable metal. ‘Brocade’, a cloth which does not necessarily use silk, is extended sense. Note: 帛 comprises 巾 1232 ‘cloth fragment, cloth’, with 白 69 ‘white’. GY2008:1609; OT1968:320,315; MS1995:v1:438-9; TA1965:822.	GOLD BROCADE ON WHITE CLOTH IS SHOWY	images/Chapter7_img_306.jpg

Has 口 22 ‘mouth’, and 今 138 (‘now’) as phonetic, the latter typically interpreted as ‘close, shut’, thus giving ‘close mouth and moan’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa) or ‘moan’ (Katō). However, moaning is normally emitted with the mouth open, a point which brings this interpretation of the meaning into question. On the basis of usage in early texts, Qiu interprets the original meaning of 吟 as ‘close the mouth and remain silent’; if this is accepted, senses such as ‘moan, sing, recite’ need to be regarded as loan usages.

Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, and 區 282 ( 区 ‘ward, section’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit, strike’, to give ‘whip a horse (and make it gallop)’. ‘Urge on/spur on’ as a general use is an extended sense.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart/mind’ and 瞿 (orig ‘bird looks round nervously’; see Note below). 瞿 is taken as semantic and phonetic (Ogawa, Gu) or just phonetic with associated sense ‘look round nervously’ (Mizukami, Shirakawa), both cases giving same overall sense ‘be afraid’. 惧 is a later popular form. Note: 瞿 has ‘look left and right’, with 隹 324 ‘short-tailed bird’, thus ‘bird looks round nervously’ (Shirakawa). Qiu prefers ‘eagle’s gaze’. MS1995:v1:530-31; SS1984:218; GY2008:1328; OT1968:392; QX2000:197; DJ2009:v3:850. Suggest 具 as 目 76 ‘eye’ with ‘hands’ / .

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 禺 (see 1244) as phonetic with associated sense either as i] ‘product’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘together, meet, resemble;’ (Katō), giving ‘effigy’. Shuowen defines as ‘[image of] person made of paulownia wood’. ‘Even number’ may be seen as extended sense based on two (original and likeness): likewise ‘spouse’. Shirakawa also takes 偶 as ‘doll, image made as likeness’, but links original sense back to 禺 , taking as initially showing effigy in shape of deity with large head.

OT1968:1072; TA1965:307-11; MS1995:v2:1400-01. As as mnemonic, we again suggest taking 禺 as a long-legged insect in a ‘field’ 田 63.

串	kushi, KAN	pierce, skewer	L2	1248	7	串刺し [kushizashi] - skewering; 串焼き [kushiyaki] - spit roasted; 焼き串 [yakigushi] - skewer, spit	Originally, pictograph of items such as shell currency on a cord (Gu, who gives an apparent OBI and seal forms, takes the items as being on a cord or alternatively a stick). ‘Pierce, penetrate’ is an extended sense, as also is ‘skewer’.

Has 扌 34 hand, and 屈 1249 (‘crouch’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘scoop up’, thus ‘dig out, dig’. Katō, however, takes associated sense as ‘turn soil with plow’, thus ‘turn soil by hand and make hole’. 掘 is given in Shuowen as ‘dig out’; for the similar-shaped graph 堀 1990 (‘ditch’), Shuowen gives meaning ‘rabbit digs/rabbit warren’. Some early texts seem to show interchangeability or confusion of usage between 掘 and 堀 . OT1968:417; TA1965:707-10; AS2007:337; KJ1970:304-5.	CROUCH TO DIG BY HAND	images/371a.jpg

Later (post-seal) form replaces 土 64 ‘earth, ground’ with 穴 860 ‘hole, cave’, and 屈 1249 (‘bend, crouch’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘dig’ (Ogawa); Schuessler, though, gives first meaning for 窟 as ‘dig in the ground, underground’. Tōdō, for his part, takes this graph as signifying ‘cave/hole hollowed out in a round shape’. Perhaps best taken as ‘that which has been dug out’ (whether by human endeavor or forces of nature). OT1968:742; AS2007:337; TA1965:710; GY2008:1665. Note: 窟 is grouped together with 堀 (‘moat, ditch, canal’ 1990) by Gu and Schuessler.	CROUCH TO GET INTO CAVE	images/Chapter7_img_320.jpg

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and CO 喿 as phonetic with associated sense in one view as ‘navy blue’, thus ‘navy silk’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa), then through extension or loan ‘reel thread’. Tōdō takes extended sense as ‘draw from surface’, thus ‘draw off thread from cocoon surface’. Note: 喿 has three mouths 品 22, i.e. ‘many mouths’, with 木 73 ‘tree’, giving ‘birds settle and sing noisily in tree’, then generalized to ‘noisy’. OT1968:793; SS1984:550; TA1965:258-60; MS1995:v1:242-3. Suggest 喿 as three wooden boxes.	PUT REELED THREADS INTO THREE WOODEN BOXES	images/372a.jpg

Has 力 78 ‘strength/effort’, and NJK 熏 (‘smolder’; orig signified bouquet of fragrant herbs smoldering over fire 灬 8 [Ogawa], or smoke rising through upper vent [Mizukami]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘much/many’ (Katō), or ii] ‘hang heavy’, i.e. be in abundance (Tōdō explains this as being as if human endeavor were to ‘hang heavy’ like incense-laden smoke emanating from a bouquet of fragrant herbs); either analysis gives same overall sense of ‘much effort’. Ogawa treats 熏 as serving not as semantic in the graph 勲 but as phonetic with associated sense ‘gather’ or ‘serve’, which he takes as giving the overall sense ‘merit in govt, merit’.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 曷 (see 謁 1048) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hold up high in hand, thus ‘hold up high’. ‘Display, print’ are extended senses. KJ1970:904; TA1965:583-7; OT1968:417.

渓	KEI, tani	valley, gorge	L1	1262	11	渓谷 [KEIKOKU] - valley, gorge; 雪渓 [SEKKEI] - snowy valley; 渓流 [KEIRYŪ] - mountain stream	Seal ( 谿 ) ; a late post- Shuowen graph; traditional 溪 . Traditional form has 氵 42 ‘water’, with 奚 (originally, ‘bound slave’: see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘caught, entangled’, taken in one view as giving ‘mountain stream with (seemingly) no way out’, and by extension ‘twisting and turning mountain stream’ (Ogawa). Gu, in contrast, takes ‘mountain valley/gully’ as the original meaning, and ‘mountain stream’ as an extended sense on the basis that most such gullies have water running through them. The seal form (CO 谿 ) ‘valley; mountain stream’ is treated separately from 渓 in Shuowen , but Kangxi zidian treats both as being the same. Note: 奚 is made up of 爫 1739 ‘claw’ – sometimes, as here, ‘hand’ – with 幺 29 ‘thread’ (here, ‘rope’), with 大 56 ‘big’ (here, ‘person’), giving ‘person bound with rope’, i.e. ‘(one type of) slave’ (Gu). OT1968:585; GY2008:1656,1091; QX2000:264; MS1995:v1:304-05; AS2007:526. We suggest taking 夫 as ‘man’ 601.

傾	KEI, katamu	incline, dedicate	L2	1264	13	傾向 [KEIKŌ] - tendency; 傾倒 [KEITŌ] - devotion; 傾斜度 [KEISHADO] - gradient	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally written 頃 (see Note below), with 頁 103 ‘head’, and 匕 (originally, pictograph of person with bent, withered leg; by extension, ‘bent’) as semantic and phonetic, usually taken as giving ‘incline the head’; later generalized to ‘incline/lean’. By seal stage, when 頃 was also being borrowed to represent several other words, ‘person’ 亻 41 was added to more clearly indicate ‘lean/incline’, thus 傾 . ‘Dedication’ is minor extended sense. Note 1: 頃 is now used to write koro ‘time, period’; see 1356. Note 2: 匕 is taken by Mizukami and Katō as originally showing a bent, withered leg, and based on shape by extension ‘ladle’. Ogawa, though, takes ‘ladle’ as orig. meaning, and Gu takes as ‘woman kneeling submissively’, while Katō considers 匕 in 傾 / 頃 as having only a phonetic role with associated sense ‘not straight’, and by extension ‘lame’, and that the Shuowen explanation should be seen as ‘head’ representing ‘body’, thus giving ‘bent body’, but this seems debatable. See also Appendix for 匕 contrasting with 匕 (‘change’). TA1965:504-9; GY2008:602,1074,11; MS1995:v1:154-5; OT1968:77,132; KJ1970:357,796; AS2007:432.

携	KEI, tazusa	carry, participate	L1	1265	13	携帯 [KEITAI-] - portable; 連携 [RENKEI] - in concert with; 提携 [TEIKEI] - cooperation, link	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 攜 . Has 扌 34 ‘hand’ and 雟 (type of bird; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘let hang down’ (Ogawa says ‘link, keep [on rope’ etc.]’), thus ‘hang down from/carry in the hands’. 携 , a popular historical abbreviated form of 雟 , now has official status. Note: 雟 is treated by Katō as made by 隹 324 ‘bird’, with top element taken not as 山 26 ‘mountain/hill’ but as similar-shaped 屮 , representing cranial feathers (not 屮 as ‘sprouting plant’); the lower element 冏 represents a graphic merging of what in earlier stages of the script was written two different ways, one being a pictograph of a window, the other seen as buttocks and anus/vagina. In the graph 雟 under discussion here, Katō takes 冏 as representing, basically, buttocks and anus (see 333), and by extension – with regard to a bird – as ‘tail-end’, with tail feathers fanning out (noting the 儿 shape in 冏 ), thus ‘swallow’; Ogawa also takes as ‘swallow’. ‘Participate’ derives from having one’s hands occupied, suggesting getting involved. MS1995:v1:254-5,234-5; KJ1970:349-50; TA1965:504-8; OT1968:425,1081. Take 乃 as plump buttocks.	CARRY PLUMP-BUTTOCKED BIRD IN HAND	images/Chapter7_img_344.jpg

Bronze form shows several short lengths of thread (or skeins), with other components, which some scholars make no comment on. These other components are as follows: i] a horizontal line midway, and ii] two short lines bottom right. Katō takes i] to signify joined threads, and seems to take ii] to show repetition. Shirakawa, however, takes (facing right, as here) as ‘cut threads’, as does Gu. Seal form likewise has 糸 29 ‘thread’ added as determinative, giving ‘join threads’. By extension ‘follow, patch, inherit’. MS1995:v2:1026-7; KJ1970:346; OT1968:779; SS1984:236; GY2008:1173,1311. Take as 米 220 ‘rice’ in corner.

Has 言 118 ‘words/speak’, and 旨 1401 (‘gist’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘go to, arrive’ at important place such as Court, thus ‘visit respectfully’; Shirakawa takes as ‘worship deities’. In Japanese, more used in sense ‘visit a shrine/temple’. GY2008:737-8,303,11; SS1984:236; KJ1970:796. Take 匕 as sitting person, 日 as ‘day’ 66.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind’, and 景 494 (‘scene’; ‘bright’) as phonetic. Difficult to analyze, and scholars seem to avoid it. Shuowen gives meaning as ‘perceive, be aware’, but Shirakawa maintains there are no examples of use in this sense in early texts, only in the sense ‘be far away’ (Schuessler). Basis for ‘adore, yearn’ (Japanese only) is unclear. 憬 occurs in only one compound, as above. GY2008:1846; SS1984:239; OT1968:387. Suggest taking 景 literally as 日 66 ‘sun’ and 京 110 ‘capital’.

稽	KIN	consider, stop, reach, bow low	L1	1270	15	稽古 [KEIKO] - training, practice; 下稽古 [shitaGEIKO] - rehearsal; 滑稽 [KOKKEI na] - comical	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations vary, and can become quite confusing. One interpretation takes the graph as 𥝌 ‘tree with tip bent over’, with NJK 耆 (‘grow old, senility’; in this analysis, the element 尤 (orig. ‘blame’) in 稽 is regarded as a miscopying of the element 耂 [an abbreviation of 老 ‘grow old’ 638]) as a phonetic likewise with an associated sense ‘tree with tip bent over’, giving ‘tree with tip bent over’ (Katō); ‘consider’ is presumably to be treated as a loan usage. There are several other analyses. One of these looks to analyze 稽 as 尤 , with CO as phonetic with associated sense ‘be caught/entangled’, giving ‘detain’ (Ogawa). In this analysis, ‘plan, consider’ is again presumably loan usage. Alternatively, a ritualistic meaning is attributed by Shirakawa to 稽 , based on an interpretation as 𥝌 ‘tree with tip bent over’, with 尤 taken as ‘dog sacrifice’ (Shirakawa takes OBI form of 尤 as depicting an [unspecified] type of animal, presumably dog 犬 19), and 旨 1401 ‘gist, tasty’ as the original writing for 詣 1267 ‘respectfully visit’; Shirakawa then takes the overall original meaning of 稽 as ‘dog sacrifice ritual’, with the deity who is revered believed to come down to the venue of the ritual, thereby giving ‘reach’ as an extended sense. Presumably, by this explanation, ‘bow low’ is an extended sense too, and possibly also related to the ritual, along with ‘consideration’. At some point the tree with the tip bending right (whereas the regular way for the grain plant determinative 禾 is sloping down further to left) acquired the regular slope to the left. KJ1970:356-7; OT1968:736; MS1995:v1:402-3; SS1984:239-40,832. We suggest taking 禾 87 as ‘grain plant’, 尤 as 犬 19 ‘dog’ with bent leg, 匕 as man sitting, and 日 as ‘sun’ 66.

憩	KEI, iko	rest, relax	L1	1271	16	休憩 [KYŪKEI] - rest, recess; 少憩 [SHŌKEI] - brief rest; 憩い [ikoi] - rest, ‘spell’	Seal ; a late, post- Shuowen graph. Has 息 351 ‘rest, repose’, and 舌 , which here appears to have been originally not 舌 755 ‘tongue’, but an element 𠯑 (CO; ‘close the mouth; by extension, ‘prevent’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, giving ‘stop and rest’. The explanation regarding substitution of 舌 for 𠯑 appears to be that confusion arose at the graphic level between the two at an early juncture (possibly pre-seal stage); variant forms for these two which are roughly similar in shape are considered to exist (Gu, Mizukami). Another commentator gives a different analysis, taking 憩 as 息 ‘rest, repose’, with 舌 as the phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, thus likewise giving ‘stop and rest’ as the overall meaning (Ogawa). Note: 𠯑 , which in one view serves here just as phonetic, itself comprises 口 22 ‘mouth’, with not 氏 522, but a different element (meaning knife for carving) as phonetic with associated sense ‘close, block’, hence ‘close the mouth’ (Mizukami). KJ1970:358; MS1995:v1:216-7,v2:724-5,1096-7; OT1968:387. We suggest taking 舌 as ‘tongue’, and also break down 息 into components 自 150 ‘self/nose’, and 心 164 ‘heart’.

Has 辶 85 ‘walk, go’, and 卬 1229 ‘look up at (originally, towards a person of higher status)’; the latter element is taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving overall meaning ‘go to greet’ (Ogawa), an interpretation which in broad terms is similar to that of another commentator (Shirakawa).

No Shuowen entry heading, but noted as variant of ; later, 鯨 was adopted as standard form (listed as such in Zhengzitong ). 魚 109 ‘fish’, with 京 110 (‘capital’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘big’, giving ‘big fish’, thus ‘whale’.

One view has 手 34 ‘hand’, and 毄 (‘carriage axle grates in its housing’) or its variant form 𣪠 as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit, strike’, giving overall meaning ‘hit, strike’ (Gu, Katō). Tōdō, alternatively, takes 𣪠 as having a semantic role (‘wheel hits against axle securing-pin’), combining with 手 to give ‘hit with hand’, a view shared by Ogawa. Note: the above meaning for 毄 is based on Katō’s analysis; the 口 shape beneath 車 33 ‘vehicle’ represents the housing for the axle, and 殳 170 ‘strike’ signifies the friction between axle and housing.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and CO 僉 (‘bring together those who disagree’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘draw tight, be frugal’ (Ogawa, Katō), thus ‘frugal person’. Note: in one view (Gu), 僉 consists of 亼 ‘lid; join’, with CO ‘contest a lawsuit; disagree’; Katō differs somewhat regarding identification of the latter element, but still agrees broadly on meaning. itself is made up of CO ‘disagree’, with CO 从 ‘follow’ etc. here taken literally as ‘two people’.

Has 車 33 ‘vehicle’, and 干 840 (originally, type of forked weapon; now ‘dry’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘stick out, project’, giving ‘cart/carriage with projecting shafts’, with the semantic range being extended to other things which project, such as eaves (Ogawa). Another analysis treats 干 as phonetic with associated sense ‘put/rise high up’, giving carriage shafts which curve up high (Tōdō); Tōdō notes that from Han times onwards 軒 was used mainly to mean ‘eaves’. Alternatively, this graph is taken to refer originally to a covered carriage used by those of higher status (Gu); presumably the cover projected over. OT1968:981; TA1965:583-8; GY2008:413.

Typically taken as consisting of 囗 84 ‘enclosure’, and 卷 (traditional form of 巻 841 ‘roll; bind’) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘round enclosure’ in one interpretation (Ogawa, Shirakawa, Gu). One scholar, though, looks to take 卷 as phonetic with associated sense ‘block, obstruct’, giving ‘enclosure which blocks exit on all sides’ (Katō). OT1968:207; SS1984:260; GY2008:1251.

Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and NJK 臤 ‘hard’ 1237 (q.v. for etymology, but originally 又 2003 ‘hand’ and 543 ‘eye’) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘hard ground’; later generalized to ‘hard’.

嫌	KEN, GEN, kira	dislike(d), hate(d), distasteful	L1	1287	13	嫌悪 [KEN’O] - loathing; 大嫌い [DAIkirai] - hateful; 嫌味 [iyaMI] - offensive	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has 兼 as right-hand element. Has 女 37 ‘woman’, and 兼 1281 (‘combine’, ‘cannot do’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘dissatisfied’, thus giving ‘woman dissatisfied’. Later, the ‘woman’ component of the meaning was dispensed with, the result being that it was generalized to ‘dissatisfied; dislike’, but the female component of the graph itself was still maintained, no doubt to avoid confusion with 1281. There are quite a number of extended or associated meanings, such as ‘disinclination’, ‘unpleasant’, ‘hatred’, ‘offensive’, ‘repugnant’ and also ‘prejudice’ and so forth – basically a wide range of negative feelings. In Chinese it can also mean ‘jealousy’ and ‘suspicion’, strongly suggesting that – certainly in earlier times – the cause of the female’s dissatisfaction involved her husband and another woman.

遣	KEN, tsuka	send, use, do, give	L1	1289	13	派遣 [HAKEN] - dispatch; 小遣 [kozukai] - pocket money; 遣り直す [yarinaosu] - re-do	Seal . Has 辶 85 ‘go, move’, and (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘continue on’ (though possibly with a semantic function also), giving ‘person continues walking after another’, i.e. ‘follow’ (Katō), or ii] ‘take just one part of something accumulated, and send/move somewhere else’ (Tōdō). ‘Send away, dispatch’ may be seen as an extended sense. The meaning ‘give’ is also probably an extended sense, deriving from the offering of items in funerary ritual (Schuessler). Ogawa notes ‘use’ as a Japanese-only usage, and this may be based on 遣 having been employed to represent the Japanese verb tsukawasu meaning ‘send, dispatch’, and then being borrowed for the separate but homophonous honorific form tsukawasu meaning ‘use’ (strictly speaking, the Old Japanese equivalents of these two verbs, but the principle involved still holds). Similarly, the meaning ‘do’ associated with 遣 may derive from the fact that the verb yaru in Old Japanese meant ‘send, dispatch’, but later there evolved yaru meaning ‘do’, as in the modern language. Note: is interpreted in one analysis as depicting hands putting a bow into a grave pit, as part of a funerary ritual (Gu), or alternatively as depicting accumulated possessions piled up (Tōdō) / clods of earth made round with the hands into a mound (Katō).

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 建 498 (‘build, erect’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bind’, giving ‘wedge to stop a cart/carriage’. Regarding the later meaning ‘lock’, Shirakawa considers this to derive from an intermediate stage involving use of the graph 鍵 to denote ‘door/gate bolt’ (otherwise written 楗 ), the sense then being extended to ‘lock’ and ‘key’.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 虫 60 ‘insect’, with CO (‘symmetry of ram’s horns’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘balanced’, giving ‘something balanced made by insects with thread’, i.e. ‘cocoon’. Note: has top element for ram’s horns, with two sides balanced, with 宀 30 (roof, covering) as phonetic with associated sense ‘symmetrical’ (Katō). KJ1970:199-200; OT1968:791; MS1995:v2:1024-5.

Has 弓 107 ‘bow’, and 玄 1297 (originally, depiction of twisted threads, now meaning ‘occult, black’) taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘attach, hang’, thus giving ‘attach to both ends of bow’, i.e. ‘bowstring’ (Katō). Alternatively, 玄 here is taken as ‘thread’, with both semantic and phonetic functions, also giving ‘bowstring’, a sense which was later generalized to ‘string’, encompassing such things as strings on musical instruments (Gu, Ogawa).

坑	KŌ	mine, pit, hole	L1	1320	7	炭坑 [TANKŌ] - coal mine; 坑夫 [KŌFU] - miner; 坑道 [KŌDŌ] - mine shaft	Seal ( 阬 ) ; 坑 itself is a late, post- Shuowen graph. Shuowen has 阬 , consisting of 阜 ( 阝 ) 1907 ‘hill, terraced slopes’, with 亢 (‘neck / throat, high, high spirits’, see 505) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘high’, giving ‘high/big hill’. This is the opposite meaning to 坑 , and Katō looks to explain the discrepancy on the basis of use of 阬 as a substitute writing for another homophonous / near-homophonous CO graph 隍 ‘dry moat’, and by extension ‘pit, hole’; such substitutions were common in early texts. Katō’s implication is that once this substitution became common, 土 64 ‘earth, ground, soil’ replaced 阜 ( 阝 ) as the determinative, resulting in a graph whose components then appeared more logical as a way of writing the word for ‘pit, hole’. An alternative interpretation, based on an explanation of 阬 in the ancient Chinese encyclopaedic dictionary Erya , takes 阝 here in the uncommon sense ‘hollow’, thus giving ‘hollowed-out pit’ (Tōdō). According to this interpretation, 亢 is being taken as the original way of writing 坑 . KJ1970:161; TA1965:398-401; OT1968:213; AS2007:250.

Ogawa, alternatively, takes 亢 in one of its meanings as ‘high’, giving ‘raise up high’, possibly meaning ‘raise the hands high (to protect the throat)’; the original meaning of 亢 is typically taken to be ‘neck, throat’; Tōdō takes it more specifically as ‘carotid artery’. KJ1970:391; TA1965:385-91; OT1968:402. As with 505 and 1320, we suggest taking 亢 as a desk and top.	HAND THUMPED ON DESKTOP SHOWS OPPOSITION	images/Chapter7_img_433.jpg

On a geo-historical note, in the Shuowen jiezi of ca.100AD, the first dictionary of Chinese characters (total: 9353) arranged according to a system of determinatives (540 in total) there are a quite remarkably frequent number relating to water and flood(/s). One may surmise that there was serious flooding around that time, even beyond China’s borders, as recorded in documentation in other countries. OT1968:572; TA1965:231,316.

Gu follows Shuowen definition of 郊 as originally denoting areas within 100 li of the capital. TA1965:270; OT1968:1019; GY2008:696.	VILLAGE MIXES WITH SUBURBS	images/Chapter7_img_451.jpg

An alternative associated sense given for 工 is ‘pass through and advance’, giving a specific meaning of ‘send produce from the regions to the Capital for the Imperial Court’ (noted by Mizukami). Mizukami also lists possible OBI and bronze equivalents for 貢 . MS1995:v2:1232-3; KJ1970:406-7; OT1968:953.	SHELL-MONEY AND WORK ARE FORMS OF TRIBUTE	images/Chapter7_img_454.jpg

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 空 17 (‘sky’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull’, giving ‘pull with the hand’ (e.g. a bow); Ogawa takes associated sense as ‘hang, and bend’, giving a similar overall sense ‘draw back/in’, as in drawing back a bow, and also drawing or pulling in reins of a horse. By extension, ‘pull back, refrain’. ‘Wait’ and ‘write down’ are meanings found in Japanese usage only. KJ1970:401; OT1968:417; SS1984:305; GY2008:123.

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 更 1323 (‘anew, change’, ‘again’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘thorn’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘make hard’ (Shirakawa), in either case referring originally to a thorny tree, specifically ‘mountain elm’. Meanings such as ‘resist, prevent, block’ and ‘trunk/stem, branch’ may be seen as extended senses. The meaning ‘outline, summary’, as in 梗概 listed above, is treated by Gu as an extended sense (in effect, a further extended sense) based on 梗 having ‘trunk and stem’ as meanings.

Has 口 22 ‘mouth, opening’, and 侯 1326 (‘marquis’, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense taken by Ogawa as ‘hole, cavity’, giving ‘throat’. Schuessler regards the etymology of the early Chinese word represented by 喉 as uncertain, while Shirakawa treats it as ‘probably onomatopoeic’ in nature. ‘Vital/key point’ is an extended sense. OT1968:189; AS2007:279; GY2008:1424; SS1984:306-7. We suggest remembering it through ‘marquis’.	MARQUIS GETS ARROW THROUGH MOUTH INTO THE THROAT	images/Chapter7_img_457.jpg

Has 頁 103 ‘head’, and 工 125 (‘work, tool’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘back, rear’, giving ‘back of the head’, and by extension ‘back/nape of the neck’. Additionally, Tōdō and Shirakawa both attribute a semantic element to 工 here, denoting a physical connection between, or support for, something above and below (head and torso); if accepted, this view perhaps provides a basis for taking other meanings such as ‘clause’ and ‘item’ as extended senses, as seen for example in the English term ‘header’ in documents.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 冓 ‘(type of) container’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘water channel, ditch’. Note: 冓 is a CO graph and was originally (OBI) a pictograph of a two-tiered bamboo container or basket(s) (Mizukami), or – in Shirakawa’s interpretation – a spinning device for bringing threads together, either way giving ‘put together, assemble’ as an extended sense. See also 701. OT1968:600; MS1995:v1:110-11; SS1984:309, 300-301. We suggest taking 井 as ‘a well’ 1575 and 再 as ‘again, twice’ 706.	BUILD WATER CHANNEL TWICE FROM WELL	images/Chapter7_img_460.jpg

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 岡 1068 (‘hill’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in a semantic range signifying strength, viz. ‘big and strong’ (Ogawa), ‘thick, fat’ (Katō), ‘hard and straight’ (Tōdō); resultant overall meaning is ‘thick strong rope’, or (Tōdō) ‘hard, straight rope/cable’.

Has 禾 87 ‘grain (plant)’, and 高 132 (‘high, tall’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘rise up high’ (Katō, Tōdō), or ii] ‘withered and hard’ (Ogawa), in either case giving ‘straw’. Regarding the meaning ‘rough draft/manuscript’, this appears to be a loan usage, though it may be that there was a semantic connection deriving from the perception of straw as something rough or coarse. The meaning ‘straw’ is now effectively defunct. KJ1970:164; OT1968:736; TA1965:261-3.	MANUSCRIPT ABOUT TALL GRAIN-PLANTS	images/Chapter7_img_462.jpg

Has 貝 10 ‘shell (currency), valuables’, and 冓 (see 溝 1340 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘exhaustively try all means’, giving ‘buy in aggressively’, and ‘buy’ as the generalized sense (Ogawa). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes the associated sense of 冓 as ‘bring together’, and considers the original meaning of 購 as probably having been ‘reconciliation, compromise’. See also 701. OT1968:962; SS1984:315,300-01; DJ2009:v2:511. As with 1340, we suggest taking 井 as ‘a well’ 1575 and 再 as ‘twice’ 706.	BUY A WELL TWICE USING SHELL MONEY	images/Chapter7_img_467.jpg

Has CO 敖 ‘enjoy oneself’ (originally, ‘emerge vigorously to a height’; see Note below) as semantic and phonetic, and 亻 41 ‘person’. Ogawa interprets 亻/人 as having been added to 敖 so as to denote mainly ‘enjoy oneself at will ’ (our italics). If, though, the interpretation of the original meaning of 敖 as ‘emerge vigorously to a height’ (Katō) is accepted, the addition of 亻/人 to create 傲 can be taken as ‘person emerges vigorously above others’, giving ‘act arrogantly’ as an extended sense. Shirakawa, alternatively, looks to interpret both 敖 and 傲 as having a ritualistic origin. Note: 敖 is taken in one view as consisting of 屮 ’shoot of vegetation’, plus 攷 (CO ‘hit and bend’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge vigorously to a height’, giving ‘sprouts of vegetation emerge’ (Katō). Shirakawa offers a quite different analysis, interpreting as representing the corpse of a long-haired old person being ritualistically beaten on a stand. OT1968:78,440,435; KJ1970:184; SS1984:318; AS2007:151. We suggest taking components as 亻 41 ‘person’, 土 64 ‘ground’, 方 223 ‘side’, and 攵 112 ‘strike’.

Has 豕 89 ‘wild pig, boar (or similar)’, and 132 (abbreviation of 高 ‘tall, high’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘coarse animal hair’, giving ‘porcupine’ (Ogawa; Gu also in agreement), or ii] ‘long’, giving ‘boar/wild pig with long mane’ (Tōdō). ‘Bristle’ gives rise to’ brush’. ‘Outstanding/splendid’ is taken by Gu as an extended sense based on the fierce nature of the porcupine, this being perceived as a positive characteristic, though it seems this might perhaps be more understandable if the graph were taken as referring to a type of wild pig. Also used sometimes in abbreviated written style as a single-graph writing meaning ‘Australia’, and in the compound writing 豪州 GŌSHŪ ‘Australia’ (formerly written 濠州 ); in the latter case, 豪 tends to be used today in place of NJK 濠 (‘moat’). OT1968:950; GY2008:1744; TA1965:264. We suggest taking the graph as a combination of ‘house’ 家 89 and variant ‘tall’ 高 132.

Original meaning of the graph 頃 was ‘tilt/incline the head’ ( 傾 1264), consisting of 匕 , originally probably depicting a bent, withered leg, then borrowed for ’ladle, spoon’, plus 頁 103 ‘head’. Later, 頃 was borrowed to write time-related words such as ‘recently’ and ‘when’, the latter providing the basis for its meaning in Japanese. OT1968:1100; GY2008:602; TA1965:508-9.

Has 鬼 1179 ‘soul, spirit, ghost’ (Schuessler has ‘originally: the ghost of a deceased who has returned to haunt [terrorize] the living’), and 云 83 ‘cloud’ (later written 雲 , also NJK for ‘speak, say’) as semantic and phonetic. Shirakawa suggests that in ancient times it was probably thought that a person’s soul was like a hovering cloud. OT1968:1140; GY2008:1539; AS2007:267; SS1984:329.

Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 貇 as phonetic; 貇 (see Note below) is variant of 豤 (CO, ‘boar bites’). Associated sense of 豤 / 貇 is taken as i] ‘cut down, cut’, giving ‘open up land’ (for cultivation; Ogawa), or ii] ‘clay which is hard to dig up’, giving ‘land extremely hard to dig up’ (Katō), or iii] ‘boar bites/digs down’, giving ‘dig down into the ground’ like a boar’ (Shirakawa). Shirakawa’s interpretation has some persuasiveness. ‘Cultivate/reclaim (land)’ is the extended sense. Note: 豸 , one of a small number of determinatives for wild animals (e.g. as in NJK 豹 HYŌ ‘leopard’) is based on a pictograph originally depicting a beast with arched back ready to pounce on its prey. OT1968:226,950; KJ1970:412; SS1984:329; MS1995:v2:1226-7. Suggest using top right element 艮 281 ‘stop and stare’.

Alternatively, 𧴪 can be taken as ‘small shells strung together’, and by extension the sound of shells getting broken up (Shirakawa). Based on the interpretation of 𧴪 as ‘small shells strung together’, Ogawa analyzes 鎖 as 金 ‘metal’ with 𧴪 as phonetic with associated sense ‘put together’, giving ‘chain’ made of metal rings joined up.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 坐 (CO; original way of writing 座 880 ‘sit’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘crumble, break down’ (Tōdō says ‘snap and get shorter’), giving ‘break with the hand’, and hence ‘break, crush’; ‘frustrate’ is an extended sense. TA1965:575-7; MS1995:v1:268-9; OT1968:414. As with 880, suggest take 坐 as ‘two people’ 人 41 sitting on the ‘ground’ 土 64.

The seal form has 刂 198 ‘knife, cut’, and the equivalent of 斉 1578 ‘equal, similar’ (traditional form: 齊 ) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘cut and make even’. Tōdō takes this to refer to the ancient practice of cutting tallies of equal shape to mark an agreement, as well as to preparing equal individual doses of traditional medicines. Over time, the medicine-related sense became predominant. KJ1970:423; TA1965:770-73; OT1968:119.	MEDICINAL DRUG NEEDS TO BE CUT UP IN EQUAL MEASURES	images/Chapter7_img_519.jpg

Has 刂 198 ‘knife, sword, cut’, and 肖 (= modern 肖 1490 ‘resemble’), taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘make small’, giving ‘shave/plane, whittle down’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or in similar vein, ‘cut off meat’ (Shirakawa, taking 肖 as ‘small piece of meat’ [treating as 小 38 ‘small, little’ over 肉 209 ‘meat, flesh’ in its variant form 月 ]). In this view, the other meaning ‘sheath, scabbard’ is seen as a borrowed usage of 削 . An alternative analysis of this graph takes as 刂 ‘knife, sword’, and 肖 as phonetic with associated sense ‘contain’, thus ‘container for knife/sword’, i.e. ‘sheath, scabbard’ (Katō); in this analysis, conversely, ‘shave/plane, pare’ is seen as the borrowed usage.

Originally written 最 510 (‘most’ q.v.), made up of 冃 (‘cover, headgear’), taken here as abbreviation for 冒 1974 ‘defy, attack’ (traditional form: 冒 ) over 取 317 ‘take’, giving ‘seize in the hand, take without permission’. Later, the determinative 扌 34 ‘hand’ was added, resulting in 撮 . The kun reading tsuma mu ‘pinch’ retains some of the original meaning of this graph, while the sense ‘take (photos)’ represents a Japanese-only usage. KJ1970:501-2; OT1968:428.

Meanings given by Schuessler for this graph are somewhat different (‘shed made of intertwined branches’ and ‘carriage box made of lath or bamboo’), but still there appears to be some consistency in the general shape of the materials involved.

One view takes as 車 33 ‘vehicle’ and 斤 1233 ‘ax; cut, chop’, to give ‘cut timber and make a cart/carriage’ (Gu, Shirakawa).

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 司 524 (‘administer, take charge’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘look carefully, spy on’, giving ‘one who spies’ (Katō, Tōdō). Most meanings of this graph as used in modern Japanese appear to derive from its original sense ‘watch, investigate’. Alternatively, 司 has been taken as semantic as well as phonetic in function, giving ‘one who is in charge’ (Ogawa); this analysis finds some support in Schuessler, who notes 司 as having a meaning ‘supervisor’ in bronze texts.

Other associated senses for 此 as phonetic in 雌 include ‘matched with (a partner)’ (listed by Mizukami). Sense generalized to ‘female (of birds, game, etc.)’. Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents also. KJ1970:265; SS1984:376; MS1995:v2:1408-9. Suggest taking 匕 as ‘sitting person’, 止 143 as ‘stop’.

諮	SHI, haka	consultation, seeking advice, inquiry	L1	1414	16	諮じゅん [SHIJUN] - consultation; 諮問 [SHIMON] - inquiry; 諮問機関 [SHIMONKIKAN] - advisory body	Seal ( 咨 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has NJK 咨 (‘inquire’), the original meaning of which was ‘sigh, lament’ (Schuessler), but it was then used also to represent a separate word meaning ‘inquire, initiate discussion’. To indicate clearly in writing when the graph was being used in the latter sense, 言 118 ‘words; speak’ was added. GY2008:916; AS2007:311 SS1984:378,367. Note 1: 咨 consists of 口 ‘mouth; say’ 22, and 次 308 (‘next’) as phonetic with associated sense taken by Shirakawa as ‘open the mouth and lament’, though Shirakawa prefers to take the idiosyncratic view of treating 口 here not as ‘mouth’ but ‘prayer receptacle’, giving (in his view) ‘inquire of the deities’. Note 2: In modern Japanese usage, 諮 is used for hakaru in the sense ‘formally inquire’, as at a committee meeting. Note 3: In socio-cultural terms the Japanese use consultations and seek advice a lot more than do Westerners, not normally from lawyers (in fact, litigation is relatively rare) but from seniors, often a section head or manager at their workplace. Doing things in the prescribed way is important, and orthodoxy is greatly respected, and – perhaps on a somewhat defensive note – it also helps diffuse responsibility if things go wrong. We suggest taking 咨 as ‘next, follow’ 次 308 and 口 as ‘mouth’, or alternatively ‘opening’.	IN AN INQUIRY, ONE MOUTH IS OPENED TO SPEAK, THEN THE NEXT	images/Chapter7_img_549.jpg

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, plus 寺 149 (‘temple’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘serve, wait upon’ (Tōdō says ‘remain in the one place [in attendance]’), giving ‘one who serves’. The sense ‘samurai’ (one who attends upon his lord) evolved as an additional, Japanese-only usage. KJ1970:480-81; TA1965:70-71; OT1968:60; AS2007:467. As mnemonic, we suggest two approaches: the first treating the elements person 亻 and temple 寺 ; the second taking the ‘temple’ apart and treating the graph as ‘soil, ground’ 土 64 and ‘hand’ 寸 920.

The first seal form given here appears in the Shuowen entry heading for this graph, with ii] noted as an alternative way of writing. In ii], 耳 31 (‘ear’) serves as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft’ (Ogawa). In the case of 餌 , the graph thus consists of / 食 163 ‘food; eat’, combining with 耳 as phonetic to give ‘food/rice softened (by cooking), rice-cakes’. Later, a semantic shift took place, giving rise to the more specific sense ‘animal feed’. OT1968:1116; SS1985:385; GY2008:905; DJ2009:v1:241.

璽	JI	imperial seal	L1	1419	19	御璽 [GYOJI] - imperial seal; 国璽 [KOKUJI] - seal of state; 印璽 [INJI] - imperial seal	Seal ( 壐 ) . Main entry heading in Shuowen has 壐 , and the equivalent of 璽 is treated in that work as an older writing. 壐 has 土 64 ‘earth’ (here, ‘clay’), and 爾 (NJK, ‘you, so’, etc.; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘push, press’, thus ‘device for making impressions’. Seal impression was into soft clay. The graph 璽 , consisting of the same phonetic 爾 as in 壐 , but complemented by 玉 15 ’jade, precious stone’, later came to be used (once more), this time to specifically denote ‘Imperial seal’ as opposed to lesser seals. The element 玉 reflects the widespread (but not exclusive) use of jade for Imperial seals; sometimes bronze was used instead. Note: 爾 is typically taken to be based on pictograph of a spinning device for winding thread onto, though Mizukami notes an alternative view which takes it as a seal with handle having cords attached.

This graph originally represented the name of a river, comprising 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’, here ‘river’, plus as phonetic. Separate from 濕 , there was another graph 溼 meaning ‘wet ground, wet’, comprising water 氵 plus 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, plus , typically taken to mean ‘cut threads’ (Tōdō takes instead as threads below horizontal line representing surface of water), as phonetic with associated sense ‘wet, soak in water’. At OBI and bronze stages, the ancestral form of 溼 lacked element 土 . Though 溼 and 濕 are treated as separate graphs in Shuowen , later they became confused, and the river name graph 濕 came to be used in the sense ‘wet’. The simplified 湿 is perhaps based on a cursive form of 濕 . Note: a historical variant once used for 濕 is 漯 , with upper element 日 mistakenly written as 田 63 ‘field’, and lower 絲 29 (threads) simplified to 糸 , though 漯 is in essence a separate graph originally denoting a river name (different from the one referred to by 濕 ). The variant need not concern us here, but it does show the complicated historical usage around 濕 / 湿 .

As the entry heading, Shuowen has what today would generally be regarded as a graph of more equitable structure than 嫉 , consisting of 亻 41 ‘person’, plus 疾 1423 (‘illness’) with associated sense ‘be jealous, hate’, giving ‘person who is jealous/hates’. Also, however, Shuowen notes an alternative form with 女 37 ‘woman’, i.e. 嫉 , and over time this gained currency to the point where it eclipsed . The favored form of this graph is a reminder that modern viewpoints and values are irrelevant to the environment in early China in which graphs evolved, and possibly at times may even prove to be a hindrance to our understanding of the historical realities.

漆	SHITSU, urushi	lacquer, varnish	L1	1427	14	漆器 [SHIKKI] - lacquerware; 漆黒 [SHIKKOKU] - jet black; 漆塗り [urushinuri] - lacquering	Seal . Originally written 桼 depicting droplets of liquid (lacquer) dripping down from a tree 木 73, signifying ‘lacquer tree’ and by extension ‘lacquer’. According to Katō, 氵 / 水 42 ‘water, liquid’ was added as a determinative at the seal stage because it was no longer realized that the lower part of the graph 桼 already included a component indicating a liquid; note, though, that the entry 桼 in Shuowen does explain this graph as a picto-graph relating to liquid, meaning ‘tree sap’. 漆 itself is defined in Shuowen as being a river name, but this is a later loan use of the graph. Lacquerware of an extremely high standard was being produced in China as early as the Han Dynasty. DJ2009:v3:876,v2:500-01; MS1995:v2:776-7; GY2008:1755,1202; KJ1970:178; OT1968:603-4.

芝	shiba	turf, lawn	L1	1428	6	芝生 [shibafu*] - lawn; 芝居 [shibai] - show, drama; 芝刈り機 [shibakariki] - lawn mower	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation, grass’, and 之 (‘go’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘wondrous’, giving ‘wondrous plant’, referring originally to a type of mushroom considered to promote longevity. ‘Turf, grass’ is a Japanese-only sense for this graph. Note: 之 is based on a pictograph. What exactly it depicted originally (OBI stage) is disputed: interpretations include that it represented i] vegetation newly emerged above the ground, or ii] a foot trying to advance beyond a demarcating line. Either way, ‘go’ is taken to be an extended sense; in the case of ii], initially ‘advance with difficulty’, then generalized to ‘advance’, go’; apart from ‘go’, this graph is also used as a convenient way of writing several grammatical function words. SS1984:365; MS1995:v1:18-19; GY2008:228. We suggest taking 之 as a zig-zag path.	ZIG-ZAG PATH CROSSES GRASSY LAWN	images/Chapter7_img_571.jpg

Has 斗 1766 ‘ladle, unit of measure’, and 余 820 (‘ample’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘scoop up’, giving ‘ladle out (water)’; the sense ‘slanting’ is a loan usage.

Seal shape is treated in Shuowen as an old form with lower element meaning ‘(type of) cauldron’, and upper element as phonetic with associated sense ‘cook slowly in liquid’, giving overall sense ‘cook slowly in liquid’. Later this complex graph was modified by retaining 者 as phonetic and adding 火 8 ‘fire’ in its variant form 灬 , giving 煮 ; we find examples of 煮 in clerical script onwards.

Has right-hand component 阝 376 ‘village, place where people live’, and 牙 1090 (‘fang, tusk’) as phonetic with associated sense unknown; originally, used in writing a place name. The sense ‘evil’ for 邪 is a substitute usage in place of another graph 衺 (CO) originally meaning ‘diagonal component on front of a Chinese gown’, and by extension ‘not straight, bent’; 衺 was gradually used less, and 邪 was often employed in its place in this extended sense (Qiu).

Widely taken as 釆 215 (hand holding seeds), with 睪 (‘watch criminals, espy’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘distinguish, discriminate’ (Mizukami, Katō), thus ‘put in order what has been divided up’, or ii] ‘divide’, thus ‘divide seeds’, extended to ‘release’ (Ogawa). Shirakawa, though, takes 釆 as claws of wild beast, with 睪 as showing corpse of wild beast (top part 罒 ‘net’ taken here as showing head). ‘Explain’ is extended sense. Mizukami lists proposed older equivalent for 釋/釈 . Note: 睪 has 目 76 ‘eye’, plus 幸 295 ’happiness’ taken either i] as phonetic with associated sense ‘espy; look for’, or ii] as separate graph from 幸 (though same shape), meaning ‘criminal in handcuffs’, either way giving sense ‘watch/search for criminals’.

Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents, though the phonetic element (supposedly 守 ) in these corresponds more to 単 instead. OT1968:642; KJ1970:503-04; MS1995:v2:840-41,v1:360-61.

Has 歹 302/520 ‘bone fragment’ (variant of 歺 , having 卜 96 ‘bone crack, divining’, over piece of bone: see Note below), and 朱 1439 (‘vermilion’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut off, cut’, giving ‘cut to death, kill’. The variant 歹 rather than 歺 is common already in clerical script as the determinative. Based on usage in an early classical text, Shirakawa feels ‘outstanding, special’ may be an extended sense of 殊 . Note: Katō, however, takes 歺 as showing top of spine. Qiu notes another possible origin of 歹 , stating ‘it first appeared [as independent graph] sometime between the Song and Yuan dynasties’, derived from shape of Tibetan letter read ta , based on close cultural contact between Song and Yuan dynasties. Note, however, that as a determinative in graphs such as 殊 the shape 歹 was already commonly used as variant of 歺 from clerical script onwards, such as in texts on wooden strips recovered from Juyan, a frontier town established ca.104BC in what is now part of Inner Mongolia.

Katō’ prefers to take the original meaning as ‘jade round in shape’, and ‘pearl’ as a loan usage. The majority view is probably the one to follow. OT1968:656; SS1984:40; GY2008:980; KJ1970:505.

需	JU	need, demand	L1	1447	14	需要 [JUYŌ] - demand (economic); 必需品 [HITSUJUHIN] - necessities; 需給 [JUKYŪ] - supply and demand	Seal . Has 雨 3 ‘rain’, and 而 (NJK; originally, depiction of a beard) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘become wet with rain and go soft’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘become wet’ (Katō), in either case giving overall sense ‘become wet’. In the case of this graph, the seal form onwards represents a different line of development from earlier, at least initially. The equivalent in OBI texts has a standing figure similar in shape to 大 56 ‘big’, accompanied by water droplets; this is found in bronze also, but more common is a standing figure with 雨 ‘rain’ above, showing the transitional stage towards later 需 . Meanings such as ‘seek; demand’ are loan usages. MS1995:1420-21; KJ1970:508; OT1968:1086. We suggest taking 而 as a rake.	AFTER THE RAIN THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR RAKES	images/Chapter7_img_600.jpg
儒	JU	Confucianism	L1	1448	16	儒教 [JUKYŌ] - Confucianism; 儒者 [JUSHA] - Confucianist; 儒学 [JUGAKU] - Confucianism	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 1447 需 (‘demand’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘weak’, giving ‘weak dwarf’. This is the view of Katō, who asserts that persons of this type were in control of various fields such as divination, music, astronomy, and divination. It is thought that shamans in ancient China were often hunch-backs or others with unusual physical characteristics. Gu agrees that there were persons in charge of fields such as those mentioned above, but makes no reference to dwarf stature or the like. The meaning ‘Confucianism’ for 儒 probably evolved as a specialised extended sense. KJ1970:508; GY2008:1892-3.	A CONFUCIANIST IS A PERSON IN GREAT DEMAND	images/Chapter7_img_601.jpg

Suggest taking the top stroke as (short) mooring rope, the dots as people sitting in it, the cross-stroke as oar, and the boat itself of course is lacking a stern.

秀	SHŪ, hii	excel(lent)	L1	1451	7	秀才 [SHŪSAI] - genius, prodigy; 優秀 [YŪSHŪ na] - excellent; 秀雄 [Hideo] - common male name	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Tends to be treated as comprising 禾 87 ‘grain plant’, and 乃 (see Note 1 below) as phonetic. In one analysis, the associated sense for 乃 here is taken as ‘extend, stretch out’, giving ‘rice (sic; see Note 2) which grows tall’, and – by extension – ‘outstanding’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘emerge’, giving ‘grain plant with ear of grain emerging’ (Katō; Gu is in agreement). Another commentator (Shirakawa) prefers to treat 秀 as originally a pictograph of a grain plant with an ear of grain hanging down, but the status of the graph he bases this judgment on is less certain. Schuessler gives the meaning of 秀 as ‘to flower and set ears’ (grain), which follows Karl-gren. Karlgren considers lower element ‘may originally have depicted the root of the plant (?).’ Note 1: 乃 (NJK, ‘whereupon; possessive particle’) is interpreted in various ways, but is typically taken as having an original meaning such as ‘bent’; this is seen in the interpretation as pictograph of ‘hunchback’ (Katō) or ‘bow’ (Ogawa), while ‘bend/curve, bend easily’ (like an ear and ear-lobe) is an extended sense noted in Mizukami. Note 2: 禾 is originally a pictograph of a grain plant, but not specifically rice (though occasionally misinterpreted as such). OT1968:729; KJ1970:513; GY2008:445; MS1995:v1:16-18; SS1984:406.

Listed in Shuowen , but not with main heading status, being noted as a less formal, more popular form. Has 衤 444 ‘garment’, and 由 421 (‘reason; means’) with associated sense ‘draw/pull out’ (Ogawa), giving ‘sleeve’. DJ2009:v2:676; OT1968:903; GY2008:1154.

Has 心 164 ‘heart, feelings’, and 秋 156 (‘autumn’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘shrink’, giving ‘forlorn, downhearted’ (Tōdō) or ‘heart grows smaller through grief’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘grief’, giving ‘grieve, lament’ (Katō).

Main heading in Shuowen has 醻 , and goes on to give 酬 as alternative form in accompanying text. Has NJK 酉 318 ‘wine’ (originally, picto-graph of a wine jar), and 壽 (or 州 320, ‘province’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘give out all round/without exception’, thus overall meaning ‘(host) gives wine to all without exception’, and by extension ‘give wine, exchange drinking cups’; by further extension, ‘reward’ and ‘reply’.

Has 足 54 ‘leg, foot’, and 就 900 (‘reach, proceed to; regarding’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘quick’, referring to sudden actions made with the foot, giving ‘stamp on, kick’. In Japanese usage, ‘kick’ predominates. SS1984:419; GY2008:1989; OT1968:976. For 就 , as in 900 we suggest taking it as 京 110 ‘capital’ and 尤 as ‘crippled dog’ 犬 19.

襲	SHŪ, oso	attack, inherit, pile up	L1	1459	22	襲来 [SHŪRAI] - attack; 空襲 [KŪSHŪ] - air raid; 世襲 [SESHŪ] - heredity	OBI ; seal . Seal form has 衣 444 ‘garment’, and 龍 (traditional form of 竜 2081 ‘dragon’), the latter serving here as an abbreviation of 龖 (‘flying dragons’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘pile up, pile up around’, giving ‘put covers over a corpse’, then generalized to ‘cover’; by extension this came to mean ‘conceal horses and men’, then by further extension to make a surprise attack, then generalized to simply ‘attack’. It is unclear as to how it came to acquire the meaning of ‘inherit’, though it may derive from funeral rites and associated conventions. Katō sees the main meaning as being the funeral clothing. He is quite specific in asserting that the graph indicates putting a kimono (or kimono-like clothing) on a corpse by folding the left side under the right side, presumably contrary to that of a live person wearing a kimono. In Chinese there is still a meaning for this graph of preparing for burial. He treats 龍 as a phonetic with an associated meaning of ‘wrong way’ or ‘back to front’, and treats ‘attack’, ‘pile up’, and ‘inherit’ as all being loan usages. Schuessler points to a link in early Chinese between a word for ‘habit, custom’, and one for for ‘additional robe, cover’ which could explain ‘pile up’ and ‘inherit’. OBI forms for the upper element 龍 ( 竜 ) vary considerably in shape; the greater part of the OBI form given above seems to represent a shape for ‘dragon’. Modern form of 襲 1459 retains the traditional form for 竜 2081 as top element. KJ1985:550; MS1995:v2:1172-3; QX2000:234; TA1965:798-9; OT1968:910; AS2007:524.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’ or sometimes – as here – ‘liquid’, and 十 35 (‘ten’) as phonetic with associated sense typically taken as ‘mix in’, giving ‘liquid with ingredients mixed in’ (Shirakawa, Gu, Ogawa). Tōdō, alternatively, prefers to interpret the associated sense as ‘enter deep into’, giving ‘liquid which has sunk to the bottom of a vessel’. SS1984:414; GY2008:193; OT1968:557; TA1965:789-94.

充	JŪ, a	full, fill, provide	L1	1461	6	充分 [JŪBUN] - sufficient, enough; 充実 [JŪJITSU] - fullness; 充当 [JŪTŌ] - allot, apply	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). In one view, has 𠫓 ‘newborn infant’ (originally, pictograph of baby being born [head first and thus upside-down]; see Note 1 below), with 儿 (‘person’; a separate graph from ‘person’ 人 : see 41 and Note 2 below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘grow’, giving ‘child grows into adult’; by extension, ‘be mature/full’ (Katō). Alternatively, 儿 is taken not as phonetic but semantic in function, meaning ‘person’, combining with 𠫓 as an abbreviation of 育 247 ‘raise, educate’ to give the same overall meaning, i.e. ‘child grows to adult’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Note 1: 𠫓 is a stylized version of the seal form, which is interpreted as infant emerging from the mother’s body (the latter represented by a curved stroke like ). Kangxi zidian lists (4 strokes) as being in error for 𠫓 (3 strokes). In early 20th century Japanese book-printed font, still written as 3 strokes (e.g. in Ueda Bannen’s Daijiten [1917]), but in modern font modified to look as if begins with 亠 ; the traditional look-up determinative for 充 is 儿 (i.e. determinative 10 [cf. 人 / 亻 9]). Note 2: Interpretations vary. Mizukami interprets the seal form of 儿 as depicting the middle part of a mother’s pregnant body in side profile with swollen abdomen. Ogawa treats as ‘person’ or ‘person kneeling’. The OBI and bronze shapes (as non-independent element) for 儿 given by Gu, very close to those for 人 , became more distinctive in seal and clerical script; Gu takes as ‘person’. ‘Fill’, ‘provide’ would seem to be extended meanings.

柔	JŪ, NYŪ, yawa	soft, gentle, weak	L2	1462	9	柔道 [JŪDŌ] - judo; 柔弱 [NYŪJAKU] - weakness; 柔らか物 [yawarakamono] - silks	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Analyses differ. One takes as 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, and 矛 2012 (‘halberd’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge’, thus ‘newly emerged tree plant is weak’ (Katō). Another commentator dismisses the proposal that 矛 is to be regarded here as phonetic, treating it instead as meaning ‘flexible wood for use in halberds’, and by extension ‘flexible’ (Tōdō). In similar vein, Ogawa interprets the seal form as depicting a tree (and hence wood), plus branches bending with fruit or cimilar, giving ‘flexible’ and by extension ‘soft’.

渋	JŪ, shibu	hesitate, astringent	L1	1463	11	渋滞 [JŪTAI] - delay; 渋み [shibumi] - astringency; 渋々 [shibushibu] - grudgingly	Seal ; traditional 澁 . The Shuowen seal form, which lacks the ‘water’ determinative ( 氵 ), has 止 143 ‘stop, (foot, footprint’, sometimes indicates motion as well as stopping) written four times, the top two being written upside down to convey the meaning ‘not move smoothly’; subsequently, 氵 42 ‘water’ was added as determinative to clearly indicate the meaning ‘water moves slowly/stagnates’. Then in block script, the element 止 written twice upside down in this graph was slightly modified in shape, but enough to obscure – presumably inadvertently – the fact it was originally 止 . By the time of Jiyun , a Chinese rhyme dictionary published in 1037, the entry for 澀 has 澁 noted as an alternative form. The lower right-hand element (four strokes) in the modern Japanese form 渋 is a device which was used occasionally for convenience in less formal pre-modern texts to represent reduplication of an element; another example in the modern script is 摂 1596 (‘take, act as proxy’), which is a simplified version of traditional 攝 . ‘Hesitate’ is an extended sense of 渋 ; ‘astringent’ is a loan usage. DJ2009:v1:136; OT1968:586; ZY2009:v2:649; GY2008:1138; KJ1970:517-8; SS1984:416; TA1965:809. We suggest taking the bottom right element as four droplets, and 氵 as ‘liquid’.

淑	SHUKU	pure, graceful	L1	1467	11	貞淑 [TEISHUKU] - chastity; 淑女 [SHUKUJO] - lady; 私淑 [SHISHUKU] - admiration	Seal . Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 叔 1466 (‘uncle’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘clean, pure’, giving ‘pure water’ (Katō) or ‘clear deep water’ (Mizukami), and taking ‘good, graceful’ as a loan usage, though it may be argued that it is an extended meaning. Note: several commentators (Gu, Shirakawa) consider that originally in bronze 淑 was written in a shape corresponding to the bronze form for 弔 1714 ‘mourn’, but Mizukami and Katō maintain they were separate graphs even at that early stage.

塾	JUKU	juku, private school	L1	1469	14	塾生 [JUKUSEI] - juku student; 塾則 [JUKUSOKU] - juku rules; 私塾 [SHIJUKU] - home-based juku	Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 孰 (distortion in shape of the seal form, orig. ‘cook’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘make level/even’, interpreted as ‘building with rooms having earthen walls either side of entrance gate’ (Tōdō), or – in similar vein – ‘buildings either side of entrance gate’ (Ogawa). The main building would have been for a person of high status (Gu says ‘palace’). Such rooms or buildings were used for education, and so by extension ‘private academy’, or in modern usage ‘cram school’. As an indicator of socio-cultural values regarding education, the majority of students – particularly junior high students – spend virtually as many hours in juku than they do at school. Most of them attend juku on a Saturday, and several nights a week. And there is often no consideration for political correctness: while Western schools typically try to keep students’ grades private, many juku not only ignore this, after a test they put on the blackboard not only the top few performers, but also the the worst few performers. Note: 孰 ‘cook’ was later borrowed as a convenient way of writing a homophone/near-homophone meaning ‘who?’. For further details, see 熟 905 ‘ripe, mature’. TA1965:179-84; OT1968:223,269; GY2008:1745; AS2007:471,457. We suggest taking the elements as lid/cover 亠 , 口 22 ‘hole’, 子 27 ‘child’, 土 64 ‘ground’, and 丸 101 ‘round’.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and CO 夋 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘break out, emerge’, giving ‘outstanding person’. One commentator (Ogawa) takes ‘outstanding person’ as an extended sense based on ‘tall person’. Note: 夋 is taken in one view as consisting of 允 ‘tall slim person’, plus 夂 ‘foot’ (see Appendix), giving ‘stand tall with both feet in one spot’ (Tōdō). Alternatively, analysed as 夊 ‘foot’, ‘go slowly’, plus 允 as phonetic with associated sense ‘advance slowly’, thus ‘drag foot and hardly move’ or ‘stand still’ (Katō). See too 酸 715 and 唆 1367. As with 715 and 1367, we suggest taking the right hand part as ‘crossed legs’ 夂 and an indelicate ‘runny nose’ 允 . OT1968:63; TA1965:693; KJ1970:59-60.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 閏 (NJK ‘intercalary month’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘exist in excess’, giving ‘have plentiful liquid’. Note: 閏 has 王 5 (‘king, ruler’) as phonetic from seal stage onwards, and 閏 has generally been taken as meaning the emperor being in his palace for a calendrical ritual. However, based on passage in Erya (an encyclopaedic dictionary probably dating back to ca. 3 rd century BC), Shirakawa maintains that the phonetic in this graph was originally probably not 王 but 壬 785 ‘thread spool’, (also here with associated sense ‘excess; big’), a graph which at the seal stage was already very close in shape to 王 , hence the possibility of confusion between the two. DJ2009:v3:916; MS1995:v2:850-51; GY2008:1136; SS1984:426-7. Suggest taking 閏 as 門 231 ‘gate’ and ‘ 王 5 king’.	KING AT GATE GETS MOISTENED WITH ENRICHING WATER	images/Chapter7_img_647.jpg

Seal onwards has 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, and 刀 198 (‘knife, cut’) as phonetic with meaning usually taken as ‘call, invite’, thus ‘call out, summon’. Another meaning (noted by Mizukami) is ‘bend back and face upwards’, thus ‘face upwards and call out’. The more complex OBI form (in bronze also), is taken to signify orig. ‘wine press made of willow branches’, with ‘call, summon’ a loan usage; this complex form was ousted at the seal stage by 召 . Other senses in Japanese such as ‘eat, drink; wear’ seem to be loan uses, taking sound value of mesu ‘call, summon’ equivalent to its meaning in Chinese when first borrowed and applying it to a homophonous verb meaning ‘eat, drink; wear’.

Has 肉 / 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, with 小 38 as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘little, small, make small’, giving ‘small model (of a person)’, probably child and parents: then by extension, ‘resemble’. ‘Lucky’ is a minor meaning which appears to be a further semantic extension based on a belief of good fortune accruing through resembling another – presumably fortunate or successful – individual.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’ and 召 1486 (‘summon’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘curve, bend’, thus ‘pond of curving shape’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), or ii] ‘small’, thus ‘small pond’ (Katō). Tōdō suggests focus of curving shape was either bottom or edges of a pond. Shirakawa disputes ‘curve’ as an associated sense, and takes meaning of 沼 to be ‘(natural) pond’, as does Gu. ‘Swamp/marsh’ seems to be a specific meaning in Japanese only.

Most commentators take 礻 / 示 723 as ‘altar, deity, show’, with 羊 426 (‘sheep’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘auspicious’, thus ‘good fortune, auspicious’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Mizukami, alternatively, takes the associated sense firstly as ‘deities appreciate good shape’, and by extension ‘auspicious’, but adds a cautionary note saying the shape and meaning of this graph are not certain. Gu takes the associated sense as ‘ritual offering’. Mizukami also lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents. OT1968:723; SS1984:440-41; MS1995:v2:948-9; GY2008:1155; KJ1985:447.

Has 禾 87 ‘grain plant’ and 爯 (see Note below) ‘lift up by hand’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘lift up sheaves of grain by hand, lift up’. ‘Call out’ is regarded as an extended sense (Katō, Mizukami); Katō suggests there was a verbal component involved when sheaves of grain were lifted and probably also counted. ‘Praise’ appears to be considered a further extended sense. Mizukami lists OBI and bronze equivalents corresponding to 爯 . Note: The OBI and bronze equivalents of 爯 do suggest something in the shape of a sheaf or bale. 爯 consists of 爫 319 ‘claw’ or sometimes – as here – ‘hand’, plus the lower element taken as either (Katō), or , in either case treated as phonetic with associated sense ‘lift up’ and giving overall meaning ‘lift up by hand’. The modern form 称 is an abbreviated shape based on early (probably Tang Dynasty) calligraphic cursive models of this graph. KJ1970:549; MS1995:v2:819-20; OT1968:731; FC1974:1623-4.

Has 手 34 ‘hand’, and 尙 1491 (see 尚 ‘furthermore’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘apply, put against’, thus ‘(that part of) hand placed onto something’, i.e. ‘palm of hand’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), or ii] ‘take hold of with fingers’, thus ‘take hold of something with fingers facing down’ (Katō). Based on seal form, shape of phonetic should have stayed as 尙 in the traditional form, but it seems to have changed to 尚 at quite an early period (clerical script, then block script). ‘Control’ is an extended sense (cf English ‘manipulation’).

Some OBI occurrences have three identical elements similar in shape to 口 22 ‘mouth’, while others have three elements similar in shape to 日 66 ‘sun’, but in all cases each element is unrelated to ‘sun’ or ‘mouth’, instead representing what appears as a small star in the sky, so the original meaning of the graph is ‘star(s)’; by extension, ‘clear light’, ‘crystal’.

硝	SHŌ	niter, gunpowder	L1	1504	12	硝酸 [SHŌSAN] - nitric acid; 硝薬 [SHŌYAKU] - gunpowder; 硝子 [garasu*] - glass	A late, post- Shuowen graph. Originally used to mean a mineral encrustation often called ‘saltpeter’, i.e. potassium nitrate, employed in traditional Chinese medicine for digestion and as a laxative. Reflecting this, the corresponding word in Chinese was at first written using the different graph (but same phonetic) 消 332 (‘extinguish’). Later, the new graph 硝 was devised, replacing 氵 42 ‘water’ with 石 47 ‘rock’. The graph comprises 石 ‘rock, stone’, and 肖 1490 (‘resemble’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘absorb, digest’, giving ‘rock mineral to aid digestion’, and by extension – based on the later use of saltpeter (Song Dynasty onwards) – ‘gunpowder’ (Katō). Ogawa, alternatively, takes the associated sense of 肖 here as ‘pointed, sharp’, giving ‘type of mineral with crystals’, reflecting the naturally-occurrent state of saltpeter. On a historical note, China is credited with the first use of gunpowder. Moreover, by the 10th century it had the most sophisticated weaponry in the world, including explosive rockets, land mines, and flame-throwers. Despite this, they were beaten by the Mongols in the 13th century. When the Mongols went on to attempt to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281 – thwarted on both occasions by typhoons (kamikaze, ‘divine wind’) – they took gunpowder-based weaponry, such as cannon and grenades. It is a profound mystery in Japanese history as to why the Japanese did not try to develop their own gunpowder-based weaponry, for they could easily have retrieved cannons from sunken Mongol ships (or, earlier, simply by visiting China). Instead, they waited until the arrival of Portuguese in 1543, with cumbersome arquebuses, which were promptly improved by the Japanese. KJ1970:608-9; OT1968:712; SS1984:445; GY2008:1397-8.

The seal form has 犬 19 ‘dog’, and abbreviation of 將 (traditional form of 将 911 ‘command[er]’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘set a dog on someone and urge on’, giving generalized meaning ‘urge on, encourage’.

Shirakawa takes both elements as semantic, but also – like Katō – leading to the overall sense ‘clear embellishment’. KJ1970:535; OT1968:346; TA1965:347; SS1984:448.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind, feeling’, with 童 385 (‘child’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Overall meaning is given in Shuowen as ‘thoughts are unsettled’. ‘Long for’ may be an extended sense.

Has 彳 / 行 131 ‘go, move’ (originally pictograph of crossroads), and what in seal form was 童 (‘child’ 385) taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘gather’, thus ‘central point where roads come together’ and by extension ‘major road’; ‘collide’ is treated as loan usage in this view (Ogawa). Later, center element was changed to 重 326 (‘heavy’) as phonetic (same associated sense), 重 and 童 being near-homophones in Late Han times (Schuessler). Another view takes earlier 童 as phonetic and probably abbreviation for NJK 撞 ‘strike against’ (Shirakawa). DJ2009:v1:160; OT1968:899; SS1984:451; AS2007:500,622.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 賞 542 (‘prize, praise’) taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘retaliate, repay (negative connotation)’, giving likely original meaning ‘pay compensation for slave previously received’ and later generalized to ‘pay back, recompense’ (Katō).

In one view, analyzed as consisting of 又 2003 ‘hand’ (but here to be taken rather as ‘handspan’), and 十 35 ‘ten’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘ten handspans’ (Katō; see 尺 895). Supposedly a linear measurement unit of about ten feet, but some latitude needs to be given in interpretation here: standards for measurement varied significantly in the Zhou Dynasty, a situation which led the self-styled ‘First Emperor’ (Shih Huangdi) of the Qin Dynasty to standardise weights and measures. Ogawa, alternatively, takes original meaning as ‘hand holding a stick’ (later written 杖 , NJK, ‘stick’), as does Gu. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent.

冗	JŌ	superfluous	L1	1516	4	冗談 [JŌDAN] - joke; 冗長 [JŌCHŌ] - verbosity; 冗語 [JŌGO] - redundant word	Seal . At seal stage, written with 宀 30 ‘roof; building’, plus a lower element interpreted as either i] 儿 ‘person’ (a separate graph from 人 41; see 1461 Note 2), giving 宂 , or ii] 人 41 ‘person’. Katō takes the former view, considers the meaning in this graph to be ‘weak hunch-back’ (based on word-family connection), giving ‘weak hunchback unoccupied at home without work’. The Shuowen seal form of this graph does have the lower element written with what could be interpreted as representing a hump on the back. However, others consider it better to take the lower element as just 人 ‘person’. Accordingly, Gu takes it as ‘person at leisure at home’, and Ogawa is in agreement, saying ‘person at home without agricultural work’; all the above scholars following the definition of the graph in Shuowen to some degree. The original form with 宀 appears to have been replaced by semantically close 冖 ’cover’ after Han times; fluctuation in the lower element continued until 几 (in this graph a shape distortion, probably inadvertent) predominated, giving the shape 冗 familiar in modern Japanese usage. Regarding other meanings such as ‘waste, excess’, Katō regards these as extended senses based on a person being without work and hence unfocused, but Ogawa regards as loan usage. DJ2009:v2:590; KJ1970:552-3; GY2008:116; OT1968:101; MS1995:v1:88-9,40-41. Suggest taking 几 as a desk, and 冖 as a cover.	PUTTING A COVER ON A DESK IS SUPERFLUOUS	images/Chapter7_img_691.jpg
浄	JŌ	pure, clean	L1	1517	9	浄化 [JŌKA] - purification; 不浄 [FUJŌ] - filth; 浄水 [JŌSUI] - clear water	Seal ; traditional 淨 . Consists of 氵 42 ‘water’, and 爭 (traditional form of 争 558 ‘conflict’) as phonetic, with associated sense disputed. Gu and Ogawa regard 淨 as an abbreviation of 瀞 ; both listed in Shuowen ; Gu lists a bronze form for 瀞 . 瀞 consists of 氵 ‘water’, plus 靜 (traditional form of 静 548 ‘quiet, calm’, see also 558), taken here by Gu as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘clear, without impurities’ (regarding still water as clear, unmuddied). The meaning of 淨 is given in Shuowen as the name of a pool near the capital of Lu (a state in ancient China). Given this, Katō treats the associated sense of 爭 in 淨 as unclear (Ogawa also takes this approach), and regards the meaning ‘clear, pure’ for 淨 as a borrowed usage in place of 瀞 . Despite some differences, all the above scholars are in agreement in tracing the origins of 淨 / 浄 back to 瀞 . GY2008:700-701; OT1968:574; KJ1970:431.

Has 宜 1188 (‘good, proper’), here in its original sense ‘sacrificial meat piled up’ with emphasis on ‘piled up’, and originally 晶 1502 (‘bright, clear’; originally, depiction of stars in the sky) (later 畾 [CO, ‘divided fields’], regarded here as variant of 晶 ), as phonetic with associated sense ‘many’, thus overall meaning ‘pile up, accumulate, repeat’. Used in Japanese for the verb tatamu ‘fold over, pile up’, and then for tatami ‘mat’. Originally, such mats were probably quite thin and readily folded. Later, though, they became much more substantial in construction, having a stiff core by tradition made of rice straw covered with a woven cover of rush straw. Being of a set size (approximately six feet by three, though there can be minor variation), with the length always twice the width, tatami mats are also used as a measure of room size. The abbreviated modern form 畳 , which has lost the short vertical stroke from its lower element 宜 and two ‘fields’, was officially adopted into the T ōyō kanji List promulgated in 1946. OT1968:673; GY2008:1673; KJ1970:718-9. We suggest taking 冝 as ‘not quite proper’. Take 田 as ‘field’ 63.	REPEATEDLY FOLD PILES OF PROPER TATAMI MATS IN A FIELD!?	images/Chapter7_img_695.jpg

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and CO 黽 (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘become twisted’ (Ogawa), giving ‘twisted fibers’. Note: as an independent graph, 黽 means ‘frog, toad’. As the phonetic in 繩 , Shuowen regards it as an abbreviation of 蠅 NJK ‘fly’, though this is academic, since it does serve only as phonetic here and has no semantic role. OT1968:792; DJ2009:v3:1071,1107; GY2008:1353. We suggest taking the right-hand part of 1520 as two ‘days’ 日 66 and the down stroke as cord/rope.	THREADING ROPE TAKES TWO DAYS	images/451a.jpg

Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 襄 (‘remove garment’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft and fertile, soft’, giving ‘soft and and fertile soil’. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. Note: the seal form corresponding to block script 襄 is made up of 衣 444 ‘garment’, plus a phonetic with associated sense ‘remove’. Resultant overall sense ‘remove garment’ is explained in Shuowen , with reference to a Han time edict directing the populace to remove outer garments and work in the fields. Abbreviation in shape of right-hand element is standard in modern Japanese (see e.g. 1522). MS1995:v1:280-81; KJ1970:554; O1968:226; GY2008:1952. We suggest taking the right-hand part as ‘six’ 六 80, ‘well’ 井 1575, and as a variant of ‘clothing’ 衣 444.	GROUND AROUND SIX WELLS IS CLOTHED IN RICH SOIL	images/Chapter7_img_696.jpg; images/441.jpg

Has 女 37 ‘woman’, and 襄 (‘remove garment’; see 1521 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘superior’, giving original meaning ‘mother’, and then – through confusion with the homophonous graph 娘 2014 ‘young lady, daughter’ – used also for ‘daughter, girl’ (Ogawa). Katō also takes ‘high, lofty’ as one possible associated sense, but notes ‘take charge’ as another, again leading to the meaning ‘mother’ (probably on the basis of one who is in charge of a household) and then too for ‘girl, young lady’. The Shuowen itself explains 孃 as meaning ‘confusion’, or alternatively ‘fat, corpulent’, and on the basis of the latter sense Shirakawa takes 孃 to refer to corpulent females, both mothers and daughters. Katō, however, considers this interpretation to be flawed. In the Tang Dynasty, both 嬢 and 娘 appear to have had a polite connotation (‘lady’ [Schuessler]). OT1968:263; KJ1970:554-5; DJ2009:v3:1027-8; SS1984:460; AS2007:401. As with 1521, we again suggest taking the right-hand part as ‘six’ 六 80, ‘well’ 井 1575, and as a variant of ‘clothing’ 衣 444.

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 定 371 (‘fix’, ‘decide’) as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘stable, steady’ (Gu), giving ‘metal artefact which is stable’, referring originally to an ancient bronze ritual food vessel with legs (Ch.: ding ). By extension or loan, it came to denote metal ingots or other ingot-shaped items such as ink cakes and tablets. ‘Lock’ appears to be a Japanese-only sense.

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 襄 (‘remove garment’; see 1521 Note)) as phonetic with associated original sense taken either as i] ‘charge, blame’, giving ‘charge, lay an accusation’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘push into’, giving ‘push someone into questioning’ (noted by Mizukami). Katō, who arrives at a similar overall meaning, i.e. ‘two persons blame each other’, regards the later predominant sense ‘concede, yield’ as a loan use. OT1968:945; MS1995:v2:1215-17; KJ1970:553-4; AS2007:439. As with 1521, and linking in with the 1522 mnemonic, we suggest taking the right-hand part as 六 80 ‘six’, 井 1575 ‘well’, and as a variant of 衣 444 ‘clothing’.

Has 歹 ‘bone fragment; die’ (see 1441), and 直 192 (‘direct, upright’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘adhere, be sticky’, thus ‘flesh on corpse rots and goes mushy’ (Katō), or ii] ‘rot, decay’, (Ogawa). ‘Increase’ is seen as a loan sense by Katō. Ogawa considers ‘increase’ derives from the graph 殖 having been used interchangeably with 植 337 ‘plant’ at one stage (both were homophones in Late Han), ‘increase’ being an extended sense from ‘plant’. Tōdō, like Shirakawa, links these two graphs and the underlying words. KJ1970:557; OT1968:544; TA1965:89.	INCREASED BARE BONES DIRECTLY ENRICH GROUND	images/Chapter7_img_700.jpg

Mizukami lists a proposed bronze form. Alternatively, is taken as ‘person in front of food vessel’ (  here is a variant of 人 41 ‘person’), with 巾 ‘cloth’, thus ‘wipe food utensils clean’ (Shirakawa). In the latter interpretation, ‘make nice, decorate’ may be seen as an extended sense. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent.

Has 寸 920 ‘hand’ beneath 辰 ‘Dragon’ (fifth of the Twelve Branches used in traditional Chinese culture for purposes such as timekeeping). Note that ‘dragon’ is an early (OBI) loan use of 辰 , which derives from a pictograph of a large clam (bivalve mollusc); Katō considers the OBI and bronze forms show clams with muscle tissue outside the shell to enable movement. 辱 represents a hand holding a clam shell sharpened for cutting vegetation. This etymology is clearly seen in the OBI form for 農 386 ‘farming’, a graph which incorporates 辱 . ‘Shame, humiliation’ is usually seen as a loan usage, but it may reflect an extended meaning similar to the English ‘cutting remark’.

Has 尸 256 ‘corpse, slumped body’, sometimes – as here – in the latter sense ‘(living) body’, and 九 13 (‘nine’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hole, orifice’, giving ‘anus’ and by extension terms such as ‘buttocks’, ‘rear’, ‘end’, ‘bottom’. Over time, the meaning of ‘anus’ itself has been virtually displaced by these extended meanings, and the common term for ‘anus’ nowadays is shiri no ana (‘buttock hole’) or the medical term 肛 門 ( kōmon ).

Consists of 艹 53 ‘vegetation, plant’, with 心 164 ‘heart’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘core/pith of plant or vegetation’. Originally referred in particular to a type of rush, the oily pith of which can be used as a lamp wick, leading to extended senses such as ‘wick’ and also to denote the central part of items such as in ‘padding (of quilt)’, ‘(pencil) lead’.

辛	SHIN, kara	sharp, bitter	L2	1535	7	辛苦 [SHINKU] - hardship; 辛味 [karaMI] - sharp taste; 辛うじて [karōjite] - barely	OBI ; seal . Originally, pictograph of a large needle with sideways projections partway down, presumably to make it easier to push the needle into the target surface. The significance of the top horizontal stroke in OBI and seal (changed to near-vertical or vertical in block script) is not clear. This graph is widely considered to represent a needle for tattooing the foreheads of slaves and criminals as a mark of ownership. Tattooing was also one of the ancient Five Punishments, the others being cutting off the nose, cutting off a foot, castration, and capital punishment (ancient Chinese culture exhibits a fondness for numerical categories). The original meaning ‘tattooing needle’ (for slaves and criminals) gave rise to various extended senses such as ‘crime’, ‘painful’, ‘bitter, pungent’. The additional meaning ‘eighth of the ten Heavenly Stems’ (used in the traditional Chinese year-counting system) is a loan use. MS1995:v2:1274-5; KJ1970:942-3; OT1968:989; AS2007:538. We suggest taking the graph as 立 77 ‘stand’ and 十 35 ‘ten’.	STAND ON TEN SHARP NEEDLES – A BITTER EXPERIENCE!	images/455a.jpg; images/455b.jpg

In one view, has 氵 / 水 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 聿 400 (‘writing brush’), itself as abbreviation of 𦘔 (‘writing brush hairs’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘river crossing place’, giving overall meaning ‘river crossing place’ (Katō). Gu, who takes 𦘔 to be the original way of writing 津 , considers on the basis of the OBI equivalent that 𦘔 originally depicted a person crossing a river or stream using a pole, and hence ‘river crossing place’. Ogawa, alternatively, analyzes as 水 ‘water, river’, plus 聿 as phonetic with associated sense ‘advance’, giving ‘cross river and advance, river crossing’, and the means to do so, i.e. ‘ferry’. The meaning ‘harbor’ is a Japanese-only usage. KJ1970:55-6; GY2008:956; OT1968:574. We suggest taking 聿 as ‘brush in hand’.

At the seal stage, the graph meaning ‘lips’ was written 脣 ( 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’), and 辰 (originally, pictograph of large clam; see 1531) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake, tremble, move quickly’, giving ‘(part of) body which moves quickly’, i.e. ‘lips’. Separate from 脣 , there was another graph 唇 , having 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’ as determinative as opposed to 肉 . Originally, 唇 meant ‘be startled’, but this graph was borrowed from the Later Han period with a second meaning, viz. ‘lips’, and the two graphs were used interchangeably until the Song and Yuan dynasties (Gu). The later Kangxi zidian prescribed only 脣 as correct usage for the meaning ‘lips’, treating 唇 as erroneous in this sense. The form 唇 was officially approved in Japan when included in the Jōyō List promulgated in 1981. GY2008:1016; OT1968:823; DJ2009:v1:117; ZY2009:v2:345; SK1996:1356.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 辰 (orig. ‘large clam’, see 1531) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake, move about’, thus ‘shake about’ (Ogawa). Katō, however, takes orig meaning ‘open up (a clam)’, and ‘move about, shake’ as extended sense from clam moving about. Furi ‘postures (in dance); manner’ derives from kun reading furu ‘shake’, as also the verbal suffix - buru ‘pose, put on airs’. Use of 振 for another suffix, -buri ‘after (time interval)’, is also loan use based on sound value furu . OT1968:414; KJ1970:560-61.	WAVE CLAM IN HAND IN SWINGING MANNER	images/Chapter7_img_714.jpg

紳	SHIN	gentleman, belt	L1	1542	11	紳士 [SHINSHI] - gentleman; 紳士録 [SHINSHIROKU] - Who’s Who; 紳士的 [SHINSHITEKI] - gentlemanly	Seal . This graph has 糸 29 ‘thread, cord’, together with 申 338 (‘say, expound’) as a phonetic with an associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘extend, stretch’, this being interpreted to give the following overall meanings: i] ‘long sash to extend around the waist’ (Mizukami, Tōdō), or ii] ‘sash to wear to straighten body posture’ (Mizukami). Shirakawa, by contrast, takes the associated sense as ‘bundle/put together’, thus giving ‘sash to bring garments together’. It appears that 紳 was used to denote more elaborate sashes of a type worn by males of noble status, thus giving rise to the extended sense ‘gentleman’. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. In Chinese, in addition to ‘gentleman’, this graph retains meanings of ‘bind’ and ‘waistband’, whereas ‘sash, belt’ is effectively redundant in Japanese. SS1984:474; MS1995:v2:1010-12; TA1965:756. We suggest taking the elements of the modern form 申 as comprising 日 66 ‘sun’ and a long vertical stroke representing piercing.

診	SHIN, mi	diagnose, examine	L1	1543	12	診断 [SHINDAN] - diagnosis; 診察 [SHINSATSU] - examination; 往診 [ŌSHIN] - house-call	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 言 118 ‘words, speak,’, together with (CO, ‘thick/luxuriant hair’, etc; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘without gap/omission’, giving ‘make a judgement without omission’ (Tōdō), or ii] ‘press down’, giving ‘press pulse of sick person and check, examine’ (Ogawa). From an early stage the concept of examination and judgement was narrowed to health. Note: is comprised of the determinative character 彡 (‘feathers’, ‘hairs’, see 115), in Tōdō’s view, a pictographic representation of long hair, beneath an element which in the seal form is 人 41 ‘person’, modified in block script to 人 . Mizukami also agrees regarding the seal stage, but suggests OBI and bronze forms might instead depict a person urinating. This is not particularly significant since the dictionary or central meaning of is unrelated to its associated sense. Mnemonically, 人 can be taken properly as person, or alternatively it could be taken as a cover. MS1995:v1:44-6;TA1965:743-6; GY2008:514.

Entry heading in Shuowen has 宷 , comprising 宀 30 ‘roof, building’ over 釆 215 (orig open hand holding grain or similar &gt; ‘divide up, distinguish’), thus ‘clarify matters deep inside a house’ (Katō). Katō considers 宀 here carries the nuance ‘deep inside’ through a word-family connection with 深 342 ‘deep’, and this is supported by Schuessler, who also notes a possible link. Ogawa takes the meaning as ‘separate and clarify matters covered over’. Gu interprets the graph (both 宷 and 審 ) as meaning ‘inquire into/examine closely inside a room’. The same Shuowen entry also notes the form with 番 215 (‘number; guard’) substituted for 釆 , i.e. 審 . Adoption of 番 as the lower element as an alternative to 宷 at the seal stage may reflect influence of an earlier variant form.

Has 雨 3 ‘rain’ (sometimes more broadly, ‘sky, weather’), with 辰 1531 (originally clamshell) as phonetic with associated sense ‘shake’, thus ‘weather that makes things shake’ (Mizukami says ‘thunder rumbles in heavy rainstorm’); sense then generalized to ‘shake, tremble’.

Has 新 165 (‘new’) in its orig meaning ‘chop tree (for firewood)’, with 艹 53 ‘plant’ added to highlight this sense – and extended sense ‘firewood’ – when 新 came to be used in loan usage for another word meaning ‘new’ (the two were homophonous in early Chinese).

Has 辶 ‘walk, go, move’ 85, and 卂 (‘bird flying’ [Gu], or ‘falcon’ [Shirakawa]). Gu takes 卂 as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘rapid’ as an extended sense from ‘bird flying’ (Ogawa is in agreement). Shirakawa follows a different interpretation and takes this element as phonetic with associated sense ‘rapid’, giving ‘move rapidly’ as the original sense. GY2008:340; SS1984:480; OT1968:993.

Has 肉 / 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, and 臤 1237 (CO,‘pluck out eye [as punishment]’) as phonetic. Associated sense of 臤 here is regarded as unclear, but possibly ‘remove’, giving ‘bodily part which removes (waste fluid)’. Shuowen explains as being where (bodily) fluid is stored. OT1968:824; GY2008:611. We suggest using 臣 543 ‘minister, eye’, and 又 2003 ‘hand’.	MINISTER PUTS HAND TO HIS BODY – KIDNEY TROUBLE	images/Chapter7_img_736.jpg

Has 米 220 ‘rice’, and 卒 564 (‘end; soldier’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pound, smash’, thus ‘rice well pounded and impurity-free’; i.e. ‘pure’. The meaning ‘smart, stylish’ is Japanese-only usage. The simplified form 粋 seems to have become popular in the Northern Wei Dynasty (387-534). OT1968:761; SS1984:484-5; FC1974:v2:1689.

Has 酉 318 ‘wine’ (orig pictograph of wine jar), and 卒 564 ‘end, soldier’ as semantic and phonetic, thus ‘finish drinking all wine offered’. By extension, ‘become intoxicated’; also, ‘feel sick’, ‘feel elated’. The form 酔 seems to be based on cursivized forms circa Tang Dynasty onwards. FC1974:v2:2285-6; OT1968:1026; TA1965:694-5; GY2008:1791. Take right-hand as 九 13 ‘nine’ and 十 35 ‘ten’.	DRUNK AND DIZZY AFTER NINETEEN JARS OF WINE	images/Chapter7_img_748.jpg

The latter element is taken either as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘lower eyelids’, and by extension ‘sleep’ (Ogawa, Gu), or as just phonetic with associated sense ‘limp, flabby’, giving ‘eyes get tired and go limp’, with ‘sleep’ likewise as the meaning by extension (Katō, Tōdō).

Has 辶 85 ‘walk, go’, and 隋 (CO ‘shredded sacrificial meat’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘follow, accompany’, thus ‘follow behind’ (Katō, Ogawa). Tōdō takes the associated sense as ‘hang down limp’, but still arrives at the same overall meaning (‘hang on, follow from behind’). KJ1970:417-8; TA1965:544; OT1968:1007,824; BK1957:23. Take right-hand as 有 423 ‘have’, and left as 262 ‘hills’.	HAVE FOLLOWERS AFTER MOVING INTO THE HILLS	images/Chapter7_img_757.jpg
髄	ZUI	marrow	L1	1567	19	真髄 [SHINZUI] - essence; 脳髄 [NŌZUI] - brain; 骨髄 [KOTSUZUI] - bone marrow	Seal ( 𩪦 ) ; traditional ( 髄 ) 髓 . What is seen as seal script predecessor of 髄 has 骨 877 ‘bone’, and 隓 (CO ‘destroy, dismantle’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘fat’, thus ‘fat inside bone’ (Katō). Later form 髓 , the traditional form, was once seen as popular equivalent of 𩪦 in which the phonetic element 隓 is replaced by 遀 (CO of unclear status and meaning); Ogawa takes associated sense of 遀 here differently from the associated sense of 隓 above, seeing it as ‘linked to inside’, thus overall sense ‘centre of bone’. Examples of simpler form 髄 date from Northern Wei Dynasty (387-534). FC1974:v2:2515; ZY2009:v4:1349; GY2008:2017; OT1968:1133; KJ1970:417; BK1957:23.

Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 區 282 (‘section, ward’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hinge pin, pivot’, giving ‘(wooden) pivot’, and by extension ‘main/vital point’. 枢 appears to be a late simplified form.

Has 山 26 ‘mountain’, and 宗 899 (‘religion’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘come together, gather’ or ‘pile up’, giving ‘mountains come together and pile up’ (Katō). Alternatively, 宗 here is taken by Ogawa as meaning ‘admired’, giving ‘most admired high mountain’. Either way, by extension ‘look up high to, revere’. KJ1970:644; OT1968:305; AS2007:363.

据	su	set, (set in) place, work	L1	1570	11	据え置く [sueoku] - leave as is; 見据える [misueru] - gaze, stare; 拮据 [KIKKYO] - hard work	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 扌 / 手 64 ‘hand’, with 居 678 (‘reside, be’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘bent’, giving ‘hand shrinks/becomes stiff’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘injury’, to give – in similar vein – ‘hand injury’ (Shirakawa) (Gu says ‘hand disease’). By contrast, Katō sees the main meaning (in Japanese only) as ‘hands being busy in a work context’, leading to a variety of extended meanings, such as ‘place down’, ‘set’, and ‘work’. In all cases, hands and their activities are core. OT1968:417; SS1984:181; GY2008:1224; KJ1985:263.	HAND IS IN SET PLACE	images/Chapter7_img_761.jpg

裾	suso, KYO	skirt, hem, cuff	L1	1572	13	山裾 [yamasuso] - foot of mountain; 裾模様 [susoMOYŌ] - design on skirt; 裾裏 [susoura] - hem lining	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 衣 / 衤 444 ‘garment’, and 居 678 (‘be, reside’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘cover what is beneath’, giving ‘(part of) garment which covers from outside’ (Tōdō); as a hem or cuff presumably involves folding the edge of fabric on the outside and fixing it onto the underside. This analysis therefore appears to already provide the meaning ‘hem, cuff’, though Tōdō takes this as a later, restricted meaning. In support of taking ‘hem, cuff’ as a later sense, on the other hand, is the Shuowen entry for 裾 , which defines it as ‘front part of a garment’. In line with this, the treatment by Gu also favors taking ‘front part of a garment’ as the original meaning, and several other meanings such as ‘back of a garment’ as extended senses. In Chinese only it can have a meaning of ‘robe’, which presumably could also be worn by males, whereas in Japan it is very much associated with females. Nor does the Chinese appear to encompass the extended concept of the ‘hem’ of a mountain. DJ2009:v2:677; TA1965:385; GY2008:1668. As one mnemonic we suggest taking 居 as 古 121 ‘old’ and 尸 256 ‘corpse’.	AN OLD CORPSE IS STILL CLOTHED WITH A SKIRT	images/Chapter7_img_762.jpg
瀬	se	shallows, rapids	L1	1573	19	浅瀬 [asase] - shallows; 瀬戸 [seto] - strait, channel; 瀬戸物 [setomono] - porcelain	Seal ; traditional 賴 . This graph consists of 氵 / 水 42 water’, and 賴 (traditional form of 頼 2067 ‘request, rely’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘push forward/affect violently’, giving ‘violent rapid current’ (Katō, Tōdō), or ii] ‘rub’, giving ‘strong current which rushes over rocks’ (Ogawa). In early China it was also applied to the name of a specific river in Kuangxi. KJ1970:890-91; TA1965:551; OT1968:613.

Originally written as just 正 43 (‘correct, proper’), the OBI form of which has a foot pointed upwards towards an element shaped like 口 22 (‘mouth; entrance; hole’,) which Qiu takes as representing a destination. Since there were two words in early Chinese (Late Han) meaning ‘correct’ and ‘march against’ respectively and these were homophones, to clearly distinguish the latter in writing the element 彳 131’go/walk along a road’ (abbreviated form of 行 [originally, ‘crossroads’]) was added, resulting in 征 . Note: 彳 together with an upward-facing foot combine to give 辵 ‘walk step-by-step along a road’ (full way of writing 辶 / 辶 85). As both 彳 and 辶 / 辶 have much the same meaning, early graphs sometimes fluctuate between the two. For this reason, in pre-modern texts variants such as, for instance, 征 written with 辶 / 辶 as determinative instead of 彳 are sometimes encountered.

Main entry heading in Shuowen has 士 521 ‘male’ as determinative, but it notes graph written with 女 37 ‘woman’ as alternative form, suggesting 壻 was probably original form. 胥 (CO ‘assist’) is phonetic with associated sense ‘intelligent’, thus – for 壻 – ‘intelligent/fine male’, or – for 婿 – ‘’intelligent/fine male for a woman’; later ‘son-in-law’.

The original way of writing this graph is generally taken as , which consists of 广 127 ‘building, house’, and 屰 675 (‘adverse’; originally, showing person upside-down) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘strike, repel’, giving ‘remove/clear away a house/building’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, taken as 斤 1233 ‘ax’ with 丶 added as a marker to indicate ‘cut, notch’, giving original meaning ‘cut and split with ax’ (Tōdō). As Gu points out, though, 斥 does appear to have evolved through changes in shape from through an intermediate stage such as 厈 , a shape from which it was a relatively small step to 斥 . Examples of 厈 can be found at the clerical script stage. OT1968:450; TA1965:353-4; GY2008:177; SK1984:357-8. Suggest taking the short downstroke as indicating ‘down’.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, and 昔 346 (‘olden times, past’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘painful, stab’, giving ‘painful heart’ (Katō, Gu), or ii] ‘make smaller’, giving ‘make the heart smaller, feel regret’ (Ogawa). It is possible that 昔 may also play a semantic role, namely ‘past’, for regret is usually felt in relation to an event that has already occurred, or if one is reluctant to commit an act that has yet to occur but one that might later cause regret.

The entry heading for 迹 (NJK; ‘place where people walk’ &gt; ‘marks left by people walking’, i.e. ‘footprints’) in Shuowen has 蹟 (NJK, also ‘footprint’) as being an alternative form. The current graph 跡 1592, considered ( Kangxi zidian ) to be a variant derived from 蹟 , consists of 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and by extension ‘walk’, with 亦 (NJK, originally ‘armpit’, now means ‘also’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘continue’, giving ‘footprints which continue’, and by extension ‘remains’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, in analyzing 迹 , Mizukami takes the associated sense of 亦 as ‘accumulate’, to give the original overall meaning ‘accumulated footprints’ (for 迹 ), which likewise gives ’remains, traces’ as an extended sense. DJ2009:v1:140; ZY2009:v4:1313; MS1995:v2:1288-89; OT1968:972. We suggest taking the right-hand element as ‘partly red’ 赤 48.	THE REMAINS ARE A PARTLY RED FOOT	images/Chapter7_img_796.jpg

Note: the OBI form of 耤 is analysed as being either a pictograph of a farmer plowing a field, or 耒 699 (‘plow’, based on pictograph), with 昔 346 (olden times, past’), the latter element itself either as onomatopoeic for the sound of a plough as it digs up the soil, or as phonetic with associated sense ‘pile up’ (MS1995:v2:1054-6). TA1965:364-8; OT1968:759; SS1984:510; KJ1970:616. We suggest taking the modern form as ‘bamboo’ 58, ‘the past’ 昔 346, and multi-branched ‘tree’ 木 / 耒 73.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 出 36 (‘emerge, put out’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘collapse, hollow’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘short, inferior’ (Katō), either way giving ‘actions with the hand are inferior’, i.e. ‘clumsy’.

窃	SETSU, nusu	steal, stealth	L1	1595	9	窃盗 [SETTŌ] - theft; 剽窃 [HYŌSETSU] - plagiarism; 窃取 [SESSHU] - theft	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 竊 . A difficult graph and analyses are diverse. The traditional form corresponds to the seal version above. Another seal form, listed by Katō, consists alternatively of’ 穴 860 ‘hole’, over 廿 , which appears to be a reinforcement of ‘hole, cave, cavity’, both these being over 米 220 ‘rice’, with overall meaning ‘rice stored in cave/hole’. This combines with (see Note below), which is taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘rob, plunder’, to give ‘plunder rice stored in cave’. Gu, alternatively, takes it as semantic and phonetic, interpreting the overall meaning as ‘bore into cave/hole and steal’. A further variation is offered by Qiu, who is supportive of taking as ‘rat makes a hole to bite things and steal rice’. By extension, ‘plunder; furtively’. The cumbersome traditional form 竊 (22 strokes) was already dropped in favor of the much simpler 窃 , in the first Jōyō Kanji List promulgated in 1923. Note: the meaning of is interpreted differently as ‘mythical creature with large head and tail’ (Mizukami), or ‘(type of) insect’ (Gu, Shirakawa), while the view referred to by Qiu appears to take as ‘rat’. KJ1970:619-20; OT1968:741; GY2008:948; SS1984:513; QX2000:230; MS1995:v2:960-61; KZ2007:1914. We suggest taking the modern form as ‘hole’ (if somewhat flattened) 穴 860 and ‘cut’ 切 173, and in accord with the probable item stolen, namely 米 220 ‘rice’.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 聶 (CO, ‘whisper’, based on reduplication of 耳 31 ‘ear’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as either i] ‘bring together, collect’, giving ‘bring together, collect’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘lift up’, giving ‘lift/hold up’ (Katō). ‘Take control’ is considered to be an extended sense (Katō, Ogawa); and as Katō suggests, ‘act in place of’ is probably a loan use. Use of the lower right-hand element of four strokes in 摂 is not uncommon as a convenient reduplicating device used for abbreviation in popular forms in pre-modern Japanese texts. (see, for example, 渋 1463) OT1968:425; TA1965:800; KJ1970:623. We suggest taking the bottom right element as duplication, here specifically four.

Seal form A consists of 亻 41 ‘person’, combining with 䙴 (see Note below) ‘raise up, move’; the explanation in Shuowen notes a connection with living a long time. Seal form B ( 仙 ), defined in Shuowen as ‘person in the mountains’, is considered to be a late, popular variant of 僊 , reflecting the practice of some individuals of going up into the mountains ( 山 26) to live and seek immortality (Gu). There are strong connections here with early stages of the Chinese philosophy or religion called Daoism. Note: another seal form includes two raised hands lifting something giving ‘lift up, lift up and move elsewhere’ (Mizukami, Shirakawa). Shirakawa takes the object being raised up specifically as a corpse. DJ2009:v2:663; GY2008:173; MS1995:v1:464-5; SS1984:515,520-21.

In one view (Ogawa, Tōdō), consists of 戸 120 ‘gate, door’ and 羽 82 ‘wings’ to signify the leaves of a gate or door which open and close, in much the same way as wings of a bird or insect move up and down in flight. By extension, on the basis of the back and forth motion, ‘fan’. Alternatively, taken as 戸 combining with 羽 as an abbreviation of 翅 , NJK, another graph also meaning ‘wings’ (Katō; same overall meaning as in the preceding view); this latter analysis follows that put forward in Shuowen .

Has 火 8 ‘fire’, and 前 177 (‘before, front’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘make complete’, giving ‘make complete with fire, roast, toast’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Gu, though, takes the original sense as to cook by heating with liquid added, probably on the basis of later commentary on Shuowen . OT1968:624; TA1965:569-72; DJ2009:v3:809; GY2008:1647.

Ogawa proposes taking ‘feel envy/jealousy’ as an extended sense. Note: consists of 氵 42 ‘water, liquid’, and 欠 496 (‘lack’; originally, pictograph of person kneeling with mouth open) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘saliva; drool’.

Has 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and 戔 545 (‘fight, cut to pieces’; the traditional form depicts two opposing halberds, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘arrange’, giving ‘put one’s feet where others have trodden’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘accumulate, pile up’, giving ‘put one foot after another’ (Shirakawa). Either way, ‘tread, step’ is the resultant meaning; ‘take action’ appears to be an extended sense. QX2000:258; OT1968:972; TA1965:569-72; SS1984:523.

Has 58 ‘bamboo’, and 戔 545 (halberds; ‘fight, cut’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘small, shallow’, thus ‘(thin) bamboo strips (for writing)’ (Ogawa); in broadly similar fashion, Shirakawa takes associated sense as ‘thin and placed on top’, and suggests original meaning may have been ‘title slip’ for a book cover. Bamboo strips were important as material for writing before invention of paper by the Chinese (what Tsien terms ‘true paper’ was invented in 105AD). OT1968:755; SS1984:524; TT1962:131-37.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and (see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken variously as ‘sink’ (Katō), ‘insert’ (Ogawa, Gu), or ‘enter confined space’ (Tōdō); despite differences, shared associated sense here is ‘enter into’, reflected in the overall meaning taken by these scholars, i.e. ‘pass through/under’, with ‘lie hidden’ as extended sense. Note: Shirakawa interprets as two hairpins over prayer receptacle to indicate secretly putting curse on someone. TA1965:807-11; KJ1970:564-5; OT1968:608; GY2008:1841; SS1984:525.

OT1968:1014; KJ1970:87. Suggest 覀 as ‘west’ 169, 己 as ‘self’ 866 and 大 as ‘big’ 56.	MOVE ONESELF IN BIG SHIFT TO WEST – QUITE A CHANGE	images/Chapter7_img_817.jpg; images/477.jpg

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 韱 (CO, ‘wild leek/chives/garlic’ [plant within the Allium genus]) taken in one analysis as both semantic and phonetic in the extended sense ‘small, fine’, giving ‘many fine threads’ (Ogawa). Another analysis prefers to treat 韱 alternatively as phonetic in function with associated sense ‘something sharp [= ‘blade’] thrusts in’, though this commentator (Tōdō) notes that in the graph 纖 the associated sense is ‘fine, slender’. Alternatively, ‘cut up fine’ is taken as the associated sense of 韱 . The overall original meaning of 繊 is ‘fine-textured silk/fabric’; this then became generalized to ‘fine, slender’. OT1968:790; TA1965:848-52. In addition to thread, we suggest taking as variant of 赤 48 ‘red’ plus one 一 , and 戈 as halberd (see 545).

Has 礻 / 示 723 ‘show, altar’ (originally, pictograph of sacrificial altar’), and 單 ( 単 569 ‘simple’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘raised earth platform’, giving ‘raised earth platform for Emperor’s rituals to Heaven’. The meaning ‘Zen’ (Buddhism) is a loan usage in which 禪 was borrowed for its sound value to represent a loanword into Chinese based on Sanskrit dhyāna ‘meditation’, but this graph may well have been selected for this role partly for semantic reasons also on account of its original meaning associated with ritual.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 斬 (NJK ‘cut, behead, kill’) as phonetic. Shuowen defines 漸 as ‘name of a river’. In considering the meaning ‘gradually’, Katō proposes a link with another homophonous graph listed in Shuowen , viz. 𧽯 , which has 走 179 ‘run’ (Qiu suggests the sense in early Chinese was ‘jog, trot’) as determinative, combining with 斬 as phonetic with associated meaning ‘move forward, advance’, to give ‘advance running at the front’; ‘gradually’ is then taken as an extended sense from ‘advance’. Another commentator proposes a more direct semantic evolution, giving a classical reference which supports the meaning ‘(rain) gradually soaks through’, and by extension ‘gradually’ (Shirakawa). DJ2009:v3:879,v1:134; ZY2009:v4:1297; QX2000:196; KJ1970:632-3; SS1984:532. We suggest taking the elements as water 氵 , 車 33 ‘vehicle’, and 斤 1233 ‘ax/chop/cleave’.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, and 善 929 ‘good’ taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘make good with thread, repair’ (Katō); originally, no doubt, with reference to clothing, but then in a broader sense. Tōdō, in contrast, takes 善 here as phonetic with associated sense ‘more than ample’, giving ‘make good without skimping’. KJ1970:635; TA1965:528.	MEND WITH GOOD THREAD	images/Chapter7_img_829.jpg

Consists of 犭 19 ‘dog’, and 且 1135 (‘furthermore’) as phonetic. The original meaning appears to have already been uncertain at the time when Shuowen was compiled, as that work explains it as referring to a type of monkey or possibly dog; associated sense of the phonetic is unclear. Gu takes as meaning a type of monkey which would lie in wait and then attack humans, and so ‘lie in wait’ is treated as an extended sense; this interpretation, though, is only tentative. Uncertain, therefore, whether ‘aim’ is an extended sense or a loan usage. DJ2009:v3:799; GY2008:684.	FURTHERMORE, WE AIM AT DOGS	images/Chapter7_img_830.jpg

Has 米 220 ‘rice’, and 且 1135 (‘furthermore’/[piled objects]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘scatter’, giving ‘unrefined rice, nonglutinous rice’ (Ogawa; Gu also says ‘unre-fined rice’), or ii] ‘coarse’, giving ‘cracked rice’ (Katō). Either analysis still gives the extended sense ‘coarse’.OT1968:761; GY2008:1310; KJ1970:641.	FURTHERMORE, THE RICE IS COARSE	images/Chapter7_img_834.jpg
疎	SO, uto	distant, shun, pass, estranged	L1	1622	12	疎隔 [SOKAKU] - alienation; 疎開者 [SOKAISHA] - evacuee; 疎々しい [utoutoshii] - unfriendly	Seal ( 疏 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). 疎 evolved as popular variant of 疏 . 疏 itself has 432 (‘baby born in flow of amniotic fluid’), and / 疋 1574 (‘leg’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pass through’ &gt; ‘baby passes from mother’s body and is born’ (Katō, Gu). Ogawa takes as ‘flow passes through’. Modern form has 束 ‘bundle’ 561. ‘Shun, estranged, distant’ are extended meanings from parturition. KJ1970:584-5; GY2008:1522-3; OT1968:676.

In one view, 斥 has semantic role, giving ‘offer verbal resistance’, hence ‘claim against’ (Tōdō). In another view 斥 is seen as phonetic with associated sense ‘go upstream, back’, thus ‘speak about something from base up’ (Ogawa). Despite some apparent divergence, both interpretations involve a process of resistance; Ogawa’s analysis could equally well be regarded as giving the overall meaning ‘go verbally against the tide’.

The entry heading in Shuowen has 氵 42 ‘water’ as determinative, and notes 遡 as an alternative, which has 辶 / 辶 85 ‘go, walk’ instead. 朔 (see 1624 Note) is phonetic with associated sense ‘return to point of origin, go back’, thus ‘go upstream’, then generalized to ‘ go back’. Today, 溯 is a variant in Japanese. OT1968:600; GY1658-9. As with 1624, we suggest taking 屰 as ‘upside-down’ and 月 18 ‘moon’.	GO BACK UPSTREAM TO SEE UPSIDE-DOWN MOON	images/Chapter7_img_836.jpg
礎	SO, ishizue	foundation stone	L1	1626	18	礎石 [SOSEKI] - foundation stone; 基礎 [KISO] - basis; 基礎的 [KISOTEKI] - elementary	Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 石 47 ‘stone’, and 楚 (see Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘place beneath pillar’, giving ‘stone to place beneath pillar’ (Katō, Shirakawa), or ii] ‘beginning’, giving ‘stone which is placed first’ (Ogawa); in either case, overall meaning is ‘foundation stone’, then narrowed to ‘foundation’. Note: 楚 ‘thicket, thorny bush; name of ancient state in China’ has 林 79 ‘forest, trees’, and 1574 疋 (‘leg, foot’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘thicket’, giving ‘small shrubs, many small shrubs’ (Katō), or ii] ‘separated, scattered’, giving ‘brushwood, scattered branches’ (Tōdō; noted in Mizukami also). Schuessler gives meaning of 楚 as ‘thorny bush/tree’ (also given in Mizukami, as extended sense). ‘Chu’ as the name of an ancient Chinese state appears to be a loan usage. KJ1970:585-6; SS1984:537; OT1968:716; MS1995:v1:680-81; AS2007:193. We suggest taking 林 as ‘two trees’ 木 73.	FOUNDATION STONE LAID AT FOOT OF TWO TREES	images/Chapter7_img_837.jpg

Has 隹 324 ‘short-tailed bird, bird’ duplicated over 又 2003 ‘hand’, giving ‘two birds caught in the hand’, and by extension ‘two, a pair’.

Has 艹 53 ‘plants, grass,’, and 壯 / 壮 1628 ‘vigorous, flourishing’ as semantic and phonetic, thus ‘vegetation grows luxuriantly’ (Katō, Ogawa). Tōdō is in broad agreement, but adds connotation ‘well-ordered’. By extension, ‘countryside’ and then ‘country estate’. It is not clear whether ‘solemn, majestic’ is a loan usage or extended sense. KJ1970:435; OT1968:853; TA1965:378-80.	SOLEMN SAMURAI BEDS DOWN IN MAJESTIC GRASSY MANOR	images/Chapter7_img_841.jpg
捜	SŌ, saga	search	L2	1630	10	捜査 [SŌSA] - investigation; 捜索 [SŌSAKU] - search; 捜し出す [sagashidasu] - seek out	Seal ; traditional ( 捜 ) 搜 . Seal form has 扌 34 ‘hand’ and 叟 (NJK, ‘old man’), the latter probably a variant of 叜 , a graph which occurs in OBI onwards. The graph 叜 depicts a hand holding fire (a flaming torch) inside a house, giving the general overall meaning ‘search, look for’; the meaning ‘old man’ is a later loan usage of 叟 . At the seal stage, 扌 ‘hand’ was added as a determinative, and this is taken by Katō as signifying specifically ‘search by hand’; this may simply be a case of a determinative added redundantly to a graph already complete in terms of its constituent elements. OT1968:415; MS1995:v1:200-01; KJ1970:643. Suggest hand(s) 又 2003, 申 338 (‘expound’) as ‘stick’ 丨 and ‘field’ 田 63, or alternatively take 申 as symbol of piercing 丨 and ‘sun’ 日 66.

挿	SŌ, sa	insert	L1	1631	10	挿入 [SŌNYŪ] - insertion; 挿話 [SŌWA] - episode; 挿絵 [sashiE] - illustration	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 插 . Has 扌 34 ‘hand’ and CO 臿 as semantic and phonetic. 臿 is analysed in one view as a pounder ( 干 840 [‘dry; shield’; see Note below]) with a mortar ( 臼 see 677), giving ‘pierce’ as the original meaning (Tōdō). In another analysis, the element combining with 干 is not 臼 ‘mortar’ but 臼 ‘two hands’, though in similar vein the meaning is ‘pierce, pound’ (Ogawa); these two shapes quite resemble each other in shape in seal, but more so in block script, hence the potential for divergence in interpretation as well as confusion in writing. The later shapes and , with a slanted top stroke, are just minor variants of 臿 . Note: 干 is considered originally to depict a bifurcated branch; usually interpreted as a weapon for stabbing, but here appears to represent something slightly different but with a broadly similar domestic purpose, i.e. a pole with handles for piercing or pounding. TA1965:848-51; OT1968:423,834; MS1995:v1:446-7; GY2008:1404. We suggest taking as 千 49 ‘thousand’ and 日 66 ‘day’.

掃	SŌ, ha	sweep	L2	1633	11	掃除機 [SŌJIKI] - vacuum cleaner; 一掃 [ISSŌ] - sweeping away; 掃き出す [hakidasu] - sweep out	Seal ( 埽 ) . Shuowen has 埽 , comprising 土 64 ‘earth, soil’ and 帚 106 ‘broom’ (see) to give ‘sweep soil/dirt’, and this is generally regarded as the ancestral form of 掃 , which has 土 replaced by 扌 34 ‘hand’. The change is difficult to date, but it is clear that 掃 was already being used in Han times. Katō prefers to take 帚 in 掃 as serving not a semantic but phonetic role with associated sense ‘make good, put in order’, giving ‘adorn and clean by hand’. The first view noted here seems more persuasive. DJ2009:v3:1120; QX2000:202; OT1968:420; GY2008:1182; FC1974:v1:940-41.	SWEEP BY HAND USING A BROOM	images/Chapter7_img_848.jpg

Originally, a pictograph of a sieve or steamer. The OBI form may be taken as depicting either, but at the bronze stage a pot – probably for making steam – was added as the bottom element, giving ‘steamer’ as the likely meaning. Subsequently adopted as a convenient means of representing several other homophones or near-homophones of abstract meaning (grammatical function words) in early Chinese such as ‘once in the past, formerly’. OT1968:478; GY2008:1507; MS1995:v1:634-5; WD1974:713-5. Suggest taking 丷 70 as ‘go away’, 田 63 ‘field’, and 日 66 ‘day’.

Has 疒 404 ‘sick-bed, sickness’, and 叟 (‘old man’; see 1630) as phonetic with associated sense ‘slender’, giving ‘grow thin’. For the modern form, we suggest 又 2003 ‘hand’ and 申 338 (‘expound, talk’).

The latter element is taken by one commentator as semantic (in earlier sense ‘put together’) and phonetic, giving ‘object put together with wood’ (Gu). In Shuowen , 槽 is defined as ‘trough for animal feed’; sense later extended to other large wooden containers such as ‘barrel, vat’. Ogawa treats the element 曹 here as phonetic, though with associated sense unclear. GY2008:1786-7; SS1984:548; OT1968:523.	OFFICIAL HAS A WOODEN TUB	images/Chapter7_img_864.jpg

Originally written 蹤 , comprising 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and 從 (traditional form of 従 ‘follow’ 902) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘footprints, track, remains’. Later, the phonetic element was changed to 宗 899 ‘religion’, resulting in the new form 踪 as a popular variant. GY2008:1810; SS1984:455; OT1968:976.	FOOTPRINTS SHOW TRACES OF A RELIGION

Has 火 8 ‘fire’, and 喿 (CO ‘noisy’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘water disappears’, giving ‘water disappears in presence of fire’, and hence ‘dry’. Note: 喿 consists of 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 品 , here representing not ‘mouths of people’ (original sense of 品 405 ‘goods’), but more specifically – based on the context with ‘tree’ – as ‘mouths of birds’, giving ‘birds singing/chirping in tree’, i.e. ‘noisy’.

Has 雨 3 ‘rain’, here in the closely related meaning ‘water vapor’, with 相 348 (‘mutual’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘divided into columns’ giving ‘frost columns formed from water vapor’ (Ogawa), an impression that might be created in some conditions. Shuowen defines this graph as ‘that which destroys and creates’, a reference to frost destroying some vegetables and fruits when it forms. Mizukami lists a proposed OBI equivalent.

Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, and 蚤 NJK ‘flea’ acting in one view as semantic and phonetic, meaning ‘scratch, claw at’, to give ‘horse rakes ground with hoof and is noisy/restless’. Gu, alternatively, takes 蚤 as signifying ‘restless’, to give either ‘horse is agitated’, or ‘groom horse with comb’. Sense then generalized to ‘disturbance, noise’. TA1965:212-4; OT1968:1128; GY2008:1529. For the modern ‘dotless’ form of flea in this graph, , take 又 as ‘hand’ 2003, and 虫 60 ‘insect’.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 足 54 ‘foot, leg’ as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘speed up’, giving ‘quicken one’s pace and close in on someone’, and by extension ‘urge’ (Ogawa; Tōdō also notes associated sense as being close to ‘quick’). Alternatively, 足 as phonetic here is analyzed as having associated sense ‘shrink, make small’, giving ‘person of short stature’, and in this interpretation ‘urge’ is regarded as a loan usage (Katō).

Has 辶 / 辶 85 ‘walk, go’, and 孫 565 (‘descendants, grandchildren’) as phonetic with associated sense seen in one view as ‘retreat, be humble/compliant’, thus ‘walk in retreat’ (Mizukami). Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘constricted, small’, thus ‘get smaller, shrink’ as overall meaning, which is broadly similar to that put forward by Mizukami.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and at seal stage was 大 56 ‘big’ ( 太 181 ‘fat’ is later variant) as phonetic with associated sense seen in one view as ‘select’, giving ‘put in water and sort out’ (Ogawa); Qiu takes meaning to be ‘wash rice’. Another view takes original meaning as ‘bathe’, and ‘select by washing’ as extended sense (Gu). The sense ‘extravagant’ may be loan use of 汰 ‘select’ in place of 泰 1665 (‘big’, ‘extravagant’); alternatively, Qiu notes the view that use of 汰 for ‘extravagant’ may be abbreviated clerical script form of 泰 which happened to coincide in shape with 汰 as a separate graph meaning ‘select’. ‘Dismiss’ is an extended sense.

At seal stage has 忄 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, with either 隋 (CO, ‘cut meat for offering’) (in the case of the fuller form 憜 ) or the abbreviated form as phonetic with associated sense ‘crumble, fall’, giving ‘motivation crumbles’ (Ogawa); Tōdō prefers to take as ‘the body slumps down’. The phonetic is alternatively taken with associated sense ‘languid, loose’, giving ‘languid feeling’ (Katō). These are quite minor differences of interpretation, all of which lead to the meaning ‘lazy’. OT1968:382; TA1965:544; KJ1970:417.

Has 馬 210 ‘horse’, originally combined with 大 56 (‘big’) but later 太 181 (‘fat’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stack, pile up’, thus ‘load up a horse’, and by extension ‘load for a horse; pack-horse’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, Tōdō traces back to a word in early Chinese meaning ‘move/transport by pulling’. This word was originally written as 佗 , but when horses were used, it came to be written either as 駝 or 駄 ; 駝 later came to be used for ‘camel’, leaving 駄 for ‘load a horse; packhorse’. Pack-horses do not figure prominently in modern Japanese life, but this graph is still employed, almost always in words with a negative connotation, as reflected in ‘poor quality’.

耐	TAI, taeru	endure, bear	L1	1662	9	耐久 [TAIKYŪ] - endurance; 耐火 [TAIKA] - fireproof; 耐え難い [taegatai] - unbearable	Seal ( 耏 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Entry heading in Shuowen has 耏 , but also notes 耐 as an alternative form. 耐 has 寸 920 ‘hand’ (here meaning ‘hold’), and 而 1447 (used for some grammatical function words; originally pictograph of beard) as phonetic with associated sense ‘can, able’, thus overall meaning ‘hold up, maintain’, and by extension ‘endure, bear’. DJ2009:v2:764; OT1968:286; TA1965:74-9. Suggest taking 而 as ‘rake’.	CAN ONE BEAR TO TAKE UP RAKE IN HAND?	images/Chapter7_img_888a.jpg

Has 心 164 ‘heart, feelings’, and 台 183 (‘stand, platform’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘become loose/slack’, giving ‘the mind is slack’, and hence ‘lazy, neglectful’.

胎	TAI	womb	L1	1664	9	胎児 [TAIJI] - fetus; 受胎 [JUTAI] - conception; 胎盤 [TAIBAN] - placenta	Seal . Has 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat’ (here, in the sense ‘body’), and 台 183 (‘stand, platform’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘begin’, thus ‘child begins to form inside mother’, and hence ‘fetus; be pregnant’ (Mizukami, Tōdō), or ii] ‘indication, sign’, giving ‘sign of (new) body’, i.e. ‘fetus; be pregnant’ (Ogawa). ‘Womb’ is an extended sense. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent also. MS1995:v2:1074-5; TA1965:81; OT1968:819.	A WOMB IS A SORT OF FLESHY PLATFORM	images/Chapter7_img_890.jpg
泰	TAI	calm, serene, big, Thai	L1	1665	10	泰然 [TAIZEN] - composure; 安泰 [ANTAI] - peace; 泰西 [TAISEI] - the West, Occident	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Interpretations diverge considerably. In one approach, taken as 大 56 ‘big’ (but here representing ‘person [standing]’) combined with ‘both hands’ (stylized in block script to 廾 ) and 水 42 in the variant form 氺 , Gu interprets the role of the hands as being to sprinkle water, thus giving the overall meaning ‘bathe’. Another view treats the same three elements as having a different overall meaning, viz. ‘make waterway bigger and improve flow’, and takes ‘tranquil, calm’ as an extended sense (Ogawa). Yet another meaning put forward for these three elements is ‘help out/rescue someone who has fallen into water’ (Shirakawa). Alternatively, the element 大 here is regarded as phonetic in function with associated sense ’emerge, escape’, giving ‘let (something) slip through the fingers in water’ (e.g. rice, when washing it) or ‘put through sieve’ (Katō). Sometimes borrowed on the basis of its sound value – more commonly in older texts – to write TAI ‘Thailand’. Correct interpretation of this graph is elusive. GY2008:979; OT1968:566; SS1984:566; KJ1970:661. We suggest taking as two males 夫 601, and 氺 as ‘sprinkled water’	TWO (BIG) THAI MALES CALMLY SPRINKLE WATER – HOW SERENE	images/Chapter7_img_891.jpg; images/495.jpg

This has 巾 1232 ‘cloth, fabric’ and 代 358 (‘replace’) as phonetic with associated meaning ‘wrap round, envelop’, giving ‘cloth bag for wrapping things in’; 袋 is also noted, though, as an alternative way of writing, with 衣 ‘garment’ 444 (here in sense ‘cloth’) replacing 巾 ‘cloth’ as determinative.

逮	TAI	chase, seize	L1	1668	11	逮捕 [TAIHO] - arrest; 逮捕者 [TAIHOSHA] - captor; 逮捕状 [TAIHOJŌ] - arrest warrant	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 辶 85 ‘move, go’, and CO 隶 ‘catch up with, reach’ (see Note below) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘reach, extend to, arrive’. Note: bronze forms of 隶 have 又 2003 ‘hand’ reaching a tail (represented by a tail-like shape, taken as an abbrev of what later was to be written as 尾 1888 ‘tail’. MS1995:v2:1404-5,v1:406-08; OT1968:1004; TA1965:748-9. Take 隶 as 肀 hand seizing target, 氺 as (sweat) droplets.	MOVE IN THE CHASE, SEIZE TARGET BUT GET SWEATY HANDS	images/Chapter7_img_894.jpg
替	TAI, ka	exchange, swap	L2	1669	12	代替 [DAITAI] - substitution; 両替 [RYŌ gae] - money changing; 取替え [torikae] - swapping	Seal form A . A graph made difficult to analyse by the fact that while Shuowen has seal form A as the entry heading, it also goes on to give two other alternative forms; the meaning given in Shuowen is ‘one side goes down’. Seal form A itself consists of 竝 (traditional form of 並 977 ‘line up’; the top part of 替 is in error for 竝 ) over an element/graph which is considered to be one which is a homograph with 白 ‘white’, i.e. a different graph having the same shape as 白 69 ’white’. The seal element/graph concerned, corresponding to the lower part of , namely , ‘is of uncertain meaning. Greater clarity, albeit provisional, is found in one of these (let us call it ‘form B’) in Shuowen which has 曰 1048 ‘speak’ instead of 白 ; form B is taken in one view as consisting of 曰 ‘speak’, and 竝 as phonetic with associated meaning ‘stop, desist’, giving ‘say “stop/desist” ’, and by extension ‘change’ (Ogawa). The third seal form (‘form C’) in Shuowen has 曰 beneath 兟 (CO, ‘advance’); this may just have evolved as a popular variant, as is suggested in the 17 th century Zhengzitong . Unsurprisingly, the majority of commentators omit treatment of this challenging graph. MS1995:v2:896-7,980-82; DJ2009:v3:841,v2:696; OT1968:479; ZZ1671:v1:551-2. We suggest taking the upper part as two ‘males/husbands’ 夫 601, and 日 as ‘day’ 66.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 帶 566 (traditional form of 帯 ‘belt, obi ; wear’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stop, stagnate’ (Gu says ‘become firm’), giving ‘water stands still’; later generalized in meaning to ‘stop, stagnate’.

Has 異 826 (‘differ, strange’, originally grotesque mask), and (CO; ‘cut off, injure’ [variant halberd]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put on top, block (by piling up)’, to give ‘put grotesque mask on top of face’. Meaning later generalized to ‘hold up to the head’, and then senses such as ‘respectfully receive (by holding up to head)’. OT1968:397; KJ1970:663-4; GY2008:1920; DJ2009:v2:380.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 睪 (see 1673 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ’entangled/linked,’ thus ‘land where aquatic plants are entangled, where lake and swampy land come together’, i.e. ‘swamp, marsh’. It is unclear as to how it acquired the meaning ‘benefit’, but possibly through ‘much [water]’. At one stage it also had a meaning ‘glisten’, which appears to have been a loan usage. OT1968:561 MS1995:v2:784-5; KJ1970:95. As with 1673, we suggest taking 尺 as 人 41 ‘person’ with backpack.	PERSON CARRIES BACKPACK THROUGH WATERS OF MARSH	images/Chapter7_img_903.jpg

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 石 47 (‘stone’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘pick up’, giving ‘pick up with the hand’ (Katō), or ii] ‘gather in one place’, giving ‘gather things together in one place’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘split open’, giving ‘cut open’, with ‘open up, reclaim’ treated as an extended sense (Ogawa). The first two commentators, by contrast, consider ‘open up, reclaim’ to be a loan usage. The minor meaning ‘rub’ may be extended from ‘clear’. KJ1970:613; TA1965:325-30; OT1968:408.

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, and 乇 (CO; ‘plant seedling’ [originally, pictograph of a tiny plant with stem having emerged up through the ground, and root below]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put together, gather together’, giving ‘make request’. ‘Entrust’ is considered to be an extended sense. OT1968:921; GY2008:35; TA1965:330. We suggest taking 乇 as ‘seven’ 七 32, plus top.	COMMITTED SEVEN TOP WORDS TO ENTRUSTED REQUEST	images/Chapter7_img_908.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_909.jpg

Originally written as 若 896 (‘young’), i.e. initially 若 was used to write words for both ‘young’ and ‘agree’ (near-homophones in early Chinese). As this graph was later borrowed for other words too, to indicate clearly the meaning ‘agree’ the determinative 言 118 ‘words, speak’ was added, thus 諾 . Depending on approach taken, 諾 has been taken in one view as 言 with 若 ‘follow’ as semantic and phonetic (Ogawa), or alternatively as 言 with 若 just as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft, pliant’ (Mizukami, Katō), either way giving ‘agree’. Mizukami also lists proposed OBI form. MS1995:v2:1208-9; 1112-3; KJ1970:676; OT1968:935; AS2007:447-8; TA1965:357-8.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 蜀 (‘caterpillar; Shu [name of ancient Chinese state]’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘dirty, polluted’, thus ‘dirty water’. Ogawa follows Shuowen , taking 濁 as original meaning river name, but Katō sees ‘dirty water’ as probable original meaning, later used to refer to dirty river. Note: 蜀 , originally in OBI as 𦉶 , showing insect with large eyes ( 罒 76) and long body ( 勹 ); at bronze stage, 虫 60 ‘insect’ was added as determinative.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, and 旦 1687 (‘dawn’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘appear on outside, expose the hidden’ &gt; ‘show flesh’. Also used in early Chinese for some words of abstract meaning such as ‘only’ and ‘but’, probably loaned for its sound value, though Katō sees ‘only’ as extended sense based on use in senses such as ‘empty’ and ‘have nothing’.

Has 月 209 ‘meat, body’, and 兌 (NJK; ‘shaman, one who pleases the deities; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘come off, remove’, thus ‘grow thin’. ‘Escape; take off/shed (clothes)’ are extended senses. Note: 兌 ( 兑 ) is typically taken as showing person 儿 41 with mouth 口 22 on top, signifying ‘call out, pray’, with ‘eight’ 八 / 丷 70 in its other meaning ‘disperse, out, away, off’; taken here as indicating either ‘words directed to the deities, pray’ by a shaman (Katō), or ‘manifestation of the spirit of the deities’ (Shirakawa).

Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, and 朋 (‘friend’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stick close together’, giving (a structure such as) ‘cover/shelves made of wood or reeds’ (Tōdō), or ‘(temporary) bridge’ (Ogawa). Note: at the OBI stage, the above graph for ‘friend’ was originally ‘shell currency on two strings’, written with a pictograph showing two strings of shell currency; this led to extended senses such as ‘pair; cluster together’, though these have become defunct in modern times.

胆	TAN, kimo	gall-bladder, liver, courage	L1	1688	9	胆嚢 [TANNŌ] - gall-bladder; 胆石 [TANSEKI] - gallstone; 落胆 [RAKUTAN] - discouragement	Seal ( 膽 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 膽 ; 胆 is a later, post- Shuowen graph. 膽 consists of 肉 / 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, with 詹 (CO; ‘talkative’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘jar-shaped’, giving ‘gall-bladder’ (Katō), though ‘bag-shaped’ might be a better description (and see Note below). Alternatively, Ogawa takes the associated sense as ‘fill’, likewise giving ‘gall-bladder’. Shuowen defines 膽 as ‘organ which joins the liver’. 胆 is in origin a different graph from 膽 , listed in the Guangyun dictionary (early 11 th century) as originally having another meaning (possibly ‘saliva’), but 胆 was subsequently borrowed to write 膽 . Traditionally the gall-bladder was perceived to be the seat of courage, hence the extended use in that sense. Today, 胆 can be used in a general, non-technical way for either ‘gall-bladder’ or ‘liver’ (see Note following). Note: in modern Japanese, the medical term for gall-bladder is 胆嚢 TANNŌ ( 嚢 is ‘bag’ [NJK]) and that for liver is 肝臓 KANZŌ (see 肝 1142), but in popular everyday usage the native Japanese word kimo can refer to either, probably reflecting the close relationship between the two. Similarly, attempts are made to distinguish the use of 胆 and 肝 to write kimo meaning ‘liver/gall-bladder’ on the one hand and ‘courage’ on the other, but actual usage may not adhere to this. KJ1970:251; ZZ1671:v2:949 GY2008:896; TA1965:839; ZY2009:v3:1017,1040; OT1968:819. We suggest taking 旦 as ‘dawn’ 1687.

Has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and (provisional meaning understood as ‘drought, starvation’: see also 265) with associated sense taken either as i] ‘suffer’, thus ‘become disheartened and sigh’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘swallow, unable to talk’, giving ‘make lamenting sound’ (Katō), either way giving ‘lament’. Basis for the minor meaning ‘admire’ is not clear. DJ2009:v1:119; OT1968:193; KJ1970:683. Take as ‘Han male’ (265).

Has 立 77 ‘stand’, and 耑 ‘plant growing’ (see Note below), giving original meaning ‘upright’ (Qiu). ‘Edge, extremity’ are considered extended senses (Gu). Ogawa, alternatively, treats 耑 as phonetic with associated sense ‘flat’, giving ‘stand with good posture’. Note: OBI occur-rences of 耑 are taken in one view as a pictograph of a young plant putting out shoots above ground and showing roots below, giving the meaning ‘pointed shoot of a plant’, and by extension, ‘beginning; edge’. This view is set out in Mizukami, who also notes another interpretation of this graph (put forward by Tōdō) as representing edges of cloth hanging down, but this is not convincing.

The popular form 痴 replaces 疑 with 知 186 ‘know’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘illness related to thinking’.

Has 艹 53 ‘plants’, and 畜 1702 taken in one view in the extended sense ‘accumulate’, giving ‘accumulate vegetables (for winter)’ (Tōdō, Ogawa).

Note: both Tōdō and Ogawa say ‘rice plant’ ( ine ), but 禾 is generally interpreted as ‘grain plant’, though Qiu prefers to take more specifically as ‘foxtail millet’, a grain plant grown at an early period in ancient China.

Has 女 37 ‘woman, female’, and 啻 (NJK ‘say just one thing, only’; later replaced by CO 啇 ‘origin’ [see 778, 779]) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘straight, direct’ (Tōdō), or ii] ‘stand facing’ (Ogawa), either way giving ‘original wife’, and by extension ‘direct lineage’. Gu also takes ‘original legal wife’ as original meaning. Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘stay in one place’, and seen to give original meaning as ‘woman’s respectful and compliant attitude’ (Katō); in this treatment, Katō regards senses such as ‘direct lineage’ as loan usages. The time when 啇 replaced 啻 in this graph is hard to establish. TA1965:462-3; OT1968:262; KJ1970:721; GY2008:769; MS1995:v1:238-9; ZY2009:v1:130. As 778/779, take 啇 as ‘funny tower’.

Senses such as ‘sincere’ and ‘inner feelings’ are best taken as loan usages (Qiu, Ogawa), though Shirakawa and Gu take as extended senses. OT1968:902; QX2000:273-4; GY2008:1104-5; SS1984:595.

酎	CHŪ, sake	sake, wine	L1	1711	10	焼酎 [SHŌCHŪ] - low-grade sake	Seal . Has 酉 318 ‘wine’ (originally, pictograph of wine jar), and 寸 920 (‘hand’) as phonetic. The latter element is considered to be an abbreviation here; views differ as to what it is an abbreviation for. In one treatment, it is taken as abbreviation for 肘 (NJK, ‘elbow’) with associated sense ‘brew well’ (Mizukami, Ogawa). Other proposals for the unabbreviated phonetic are 時 151 (‘time’, Gu) and 丑 1454 (‘ox’, Shirakawa; see Note below). Despite some variation regarding the phonetic, commentators agree on the overall meaning ‘strong alcohol’; Schuessler says ‘spirits with sediment’. In Japan, it refers to lower-grade distilled alcohol with high alcohol content, made from sweet potato or rice wine lees. Mizukami lists a proposed bronze equivalent. Note: 丑 was originally (OBI) a pictograph of a hand with fingers bent, about to grab hold of something, hence ‘grab with the hand’. It was subsequently borrowed to signify ‘Ox’ as the second of the Twelve Branches, used in traditional Chinese culture for such things as marking year dates on a recurrent cycle of sixty years. Shirakawa’s proposal is based on similarity in shape at the seal stage between 丑 and 寸 . MS1995:v2:1346-7,v1:6-7; OT1968:1026; GY2008:1014-15; AS2007:345.

Bronze forms vary somewhat, and all are different in structure from the seal form. The bronze form has hands – or more probably pincers – holding a container upside down over fire and metal, and so readily understood as ‘cast’ (Shirakawa); also includes an element which appears to be phonetic with associated sense ‘red’ (as of molten metal) (Katō).The seal form 鑄 consists of 金 16 ‘metal’, with 壽 (traditional form of 寿 1445 ‘long life’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘melt’, giving ‘melt and pour metal’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘extend everywhere’, giving ‘pour molten metal everywhere within a mold’ (Tōdō); either way, the overall meaning is ‘cast metal’.

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, and 兆 573 (‘sign, omen’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘leap up’, thus ‘raise up high with hands’, giving ‘challenge, confront’ (Ogawa), presumably taking raised hands as confrontational posture. Alternatively, 兆 here is taken as associated sense ‘divide in two, open’ (Tōdō), though how this relates to ‘challenge’ is not clear. OT1968:414; TA1965:243-4.

Has 彡 115, a determinative taken to signify ‘decorative feathers/features’, combined with 周 532 ‘encircle, around’, taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘surround with decorative carving’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). In another analysis, 周 is taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘knife’, giving ‘fashion decorative elements with knife’ (Katō); based on a short passage in Lun Yu ( The Analects of Confucius ), Katō maintains that the original meaning of 彫 is ‘carve wood with knife’.

Has 金 16 ‘metal’, and 勺 ‘scoop up, catch’ (see Note below) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘scoop up/catch (fish)’. Alternatively, 勺 is taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘pull out’, but still giving essentially the same meaning, in this view ‘pull fish out of water’ (Tōdō). It is unclear as to how 釣 came to mean ‘monetary change’. Note: 勺 was originally (OBI stage) a pictograph of a scoop or ladle, giving ‘scoop up’ as an extended sense. It was removed as an independent graph from the Jōyō kanji List in 2010. OT1968:1037; GY2008:639; TA1965:247-8; MS1995:v1:146-7.	FISH WITH LADLE-LIKE METAL HOOK	images/Chapter7_img_964.jpg

In one analysis, has 貝 10 ‘shell currency, valuables’, and 占 1598 (‘divination’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘store, put aside’, thus ‘give as security’ as the early meaning (Ogawa). In Shirakawa’s view, however, this represents the later meaning as given in Shuowen xinfu . On the basis of earlier usage, he takes the original meaning as ‘add to, supplement’, and points out that in the Tang Dynasty when Imperial edicts were amended this was referred to in Chinese as 貼黄 ( tie huang ) ‘attach/stick yellow [paper]’.

Has 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, and 兆 573 (‘sign, omen’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘leap up’, thus ‘dance upwards’ (Ogawa). Shirakawa considers 兆 also has a semantic function here, linking it to the cracks which ran along a turtle shell when heated as part of the divination process employed in Shang times (see 573).

Has as abbrev of 微 1890 ‘faint, indistinct’, with (‘stand straight/tall; sign, indication’; see Note below) with associated sense taken in one view as ‘show’, thus ‘give hint/subtle indication of will’ (Katō, Ogawa), and ‘sign, indication’ as extended sense. Shirakawa looks to attribute a ritualistic, shamanist-orientated derivation to this graph. Mizukami lists proposed bronze equivalents also. Note: Tōdō, however, takes as 王 5 ‘ruler’, and as phonetic with associated sense ‘raise up’, thus ‘ruler elevates/promotes’. Most scholars, though, regard as originally , not 王 . ‘Summon’, ‘collect’ seem extended senses. DJ2009:v2:669; KJ1970:803-04; MS1995:v1:490-92; OT1968:355; TA1965:93-5; SS1984:604-5.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and (Shirakawa treats as abbrev of 徴 1722 ‘sign; summon’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘go through’, thus ‘water is see-through/clear’ (Katō). Ogawa, though, takes the phonetic 登 in 澄 as having associated sense ‘gradually becomes clear’, thus ‘cloudy water becomes clear’. Katō sees 澄 as a popular form, but Shirakawa rejects this proposed lower status on the grounds that 澄 was already used in Han epitaphs. 澄 best seen as alternative form of 澂 that later became predominant. DJ2009:v3:899; KJ1970:733; OT1968:608; SS1984:606. Use 登 382 ‘climb’.	WATER CLEARS AS ONE CLIMBS UP RIVER	images/512a.jpg

Modern form 心 164 ‘heart, mind’, with 徴 as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘change, renew’, thus ‘reform’ (Katō), or ii] ‘clarify’, giving ‘find out past wrongs/transgressions’ (Ogawa). The latter analysis leads to ‘chastise’ as extended sense. Kangxi zidian retains the form with (‘stand up straight/tall, tower above; sign’) as phonetic, but in the modern period this has been modified to 王 5 ‘king’, on the basis of the latter being a similarly-shaped element which is commonly occurrent.

Mizukami gives proposed OBI equivalents which have 貝 10 ‘shell currency’ together with an enclosing element of uncertain meaning. Note: OBI and bronze occurrences of 㐱 have 人 41 ‘person’ combined with 彡 (see 115, 517), an element which is interpreted not in its typical determinative meaning ‘decorative feathers/features’ but as a shape representing thick human hair. Note also that as a determinative jade 玉 almost always drops its dot. OT1968:655; MS1995:v2:854-5; GY2008:178-9; BK1957:123-4. We suggest taking top right as ‘person’ 人 41, and 彡 as scratches.

In modern Japanese, refers to a variety of tree (J. shii [members of beech family including Castanopsis sieboldii ]).

Taken in one interpretation as depicting either claws or talons (Shirakawa), or in another as a human hand with fingers apart, poised to grasp something (Mizukami, Gu, Ogawa). Mizukami lists several proposed OBI forms, and if these are accepted then they do seem to represent a hand rather than a claw. ‘Hand’ is often the more appropriate sense in compound graphs, where 爪 is usually represented in the modified shape 爫 (see e.g. 採 709 ‘take, gather’). The latter two commentators consider ‘claw, talon’ etc. to be borrowed usage, but it seems better to take as extended sense (if ‘hand’ is considered to be what is originally depicted).

Regarding i] above, it is worth noting that cranes are very vocal birds, and at least some varieties have cries which carry a long distance.

Traditional form has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, and 𡈼 1722 (‘stand up straight/tall; sign, indication’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘extend in a straight/direct manner, show’, giving ‘show, express clearly in words’. Note: the lower element 𡈼 is given in Mizukami’s entry heading for 呈 as 壬 (‘spinning spool’), but is clearly an error; this may have crept in at the typesetting stage. Modern computer fonts for Japanese (and Chinese) typically do not support the 𡈼 / 壬 distinction; they support only the latter. (See Appendix.) OT1968:173; MS1995:v1:220-21,262-3,282-3; KJ1970:708-9.

In minor variation of interpretation, Tōdō notes 抵 is used in (unspecified) classical Chinese texts with slightly different meaning ‘reach up to/against’. Note: fuller OBI forms corresponding to 氐 have an element interpreted as a depiction of hillocks, with a horizontal stroke underneath, thus ‘flat land at foot of hillocks’ (Mizukami).

The meaning ‘make clear, clarify’ for 諦 was carried over into pre-modern Japanese as akiramu ; following this, 諦 was later borrowed for its sound value to represent a separate verb akiramu meaning ‘give up (the idea, etc.), resign oneself to’, leading to modern akirameru . In modern Japanese, akirameru is only used in the latter sense. OT1968:938; SS1984:620; TA1965:470-73.	RESIGN ONESELF AFTER HEARING EMPEROR’S WORDS	images/Chapter7_img_1016.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 尼 1819 (‘nun, priestess’) as phonetic. Katō treats the associated sense as unclear, on the basis that 泥 denotes a river name. This is the explanation in Shuowen , but another commentator (Ogawa) takes 尼 as phonetic with associated sense ‘be sticky’, giving ‘muddy water, mud’; this view is supported by Shirakawa, who takes the original meaning to be not a river name but ‘mud’.

Orig. apparently referred to picking fruit, but later more generalized ‘picking’. TA1965:470-73; GY2008:1706; KJ1970:721; SS1984:623; OT1968:427.

KJ1970:721; OT1968:604-05; TA1965:470-73. As with 1756, we suggest taking 啇 as ‘odd’ tower (see also 高 132).	WATER DRIPS AT THE ODD TOWER	images/Chapter7_img_1019.jpg

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 弱 (which is in fact the traditional form of 弱 154 ‘weak’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear) to denote a river name. 溺 appears to have been borrowed at an early stage to represent a homophone or near-homo-phone meaning ‘drown’. We suggest taking it as 弱 ‘weak’ 154. OT1968:601; SS1984:1625; GY2008:1660.	IF WEAK IN THE WATER, YOU MIGHT GET DROWNED	images/Chapter7_img_1020.jpg

Has 口 22 ‘mouth, speak’, and 折 551 (‘bend, break’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut with ax’ and by extension ‘clearly decide’, giving ‘make (appropriate) judgement’, as when decisively cutting trees with ax (Mizukami, Ogawa). By contrast, Gu feels 悊 may be ancestral form (bronze) of 哲 , with 心 164 ‘heart, mind’ as determinative and not 口 . Mizukami takes 悊 as 心 combined with 折 as phonetic (same associated sense as above), giving ‘decide clearly in one’s mind’; ‘respect’, ‘find out, clear, perceive, comprehend, wise’ are treated as loan senses. Mizukami is not as confident, though, that 悊 is the ancestral form of 哲 , suggesting rather that 悊 might just have served sometimes as a loan writing in place of 哲 . Shuowen has 哲 in the main heading, with 悊 noted as an alternative form. DJ2009:v1:109; MS1995:v1:232-3,510-12; OT1968:183; GY2008:1027.

添	TEN, so	accompany, add	L1	1763	11	添加 [TENKA] - annex, addition; 添付 [TENPU] - append; 添え木 [soegi] - splint, brace	Seal ( 沾 ): . The ancestral form of 添 is considered to be 沾 , which consists of 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’, combined with 占 1598 (‘perform divination; occupy’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view either as ‘supply beyond needs’, giving ‘overflow’ (Katō), or ii] ‘adhere, stay’, giving ‘become moist/wet’ (Ogawa); Shirakawa diverges somewhat, treating the overall meaning as ‘add to/increase items of food’, though this does not explain the presence of the element 水 . Another different analysis of 沾 takes 占 as having the associated sense ‘stay at one spot/place’, giving ‘cause/drop a stain’ (Tōdō) At a later stage (post- Shuowen ), 沾 sometimes came to be written instead as 添 (see Note below) in popular usage, and the latter form subsequently became predominant for the sense ‘add’. Katō regards ‘add’ as an extended sense from ‘overflow, full of water’. Note: in relation to 沾 , 添 replaces the phonetic element 占 here with 忝 (CO; ‘feel shame’) as phonetic, both have the same sound value in early Chinese. KJ1970:725-6; OT1968:567; GY2008:1315; SS1984:629-30; TA1965:836-8. We suggest taking 夭 as a ‘big man’ 大 56 and as an odd variant of 忄 / 心 164 ‘heart/feelings’.

Has 土 64 ‘soil, ground’, with 眞 341 (traditional form of 真 ‘truth, essence’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘block, fill up’, thus ‘fill/block with earth’. This is one of several proposed etymologies for 眞 (see 341). Shirakawa offers a different view, taking 眞 in the sense representing the main interpretation, i.e ‘person upside down’ (again, see 341), thus overall original meaning for 塡 as ‘ritually bury upside-down a dead person who met unfortunate end (through disaster, murder, etc.)’. According to Shirakawa, this ritual was performed to bring repose to the soul of such a person; in the latter view, ‘fill up, block’ is a generalized sense. Note modern simplified form 填 .

One view treats as 殳 ‘strike’ 170 (see Note below), with left hand part of (explained below) taken as phonetic, serving as onomatopoeic for the sound of hitting something, to give ‘hit something and make noise’ (Katō, Ogawa). This view is based on traditional explanation in Shuowen . Tōdō takes a different view, following instead information from the Han Dynasty character textbook Jijiupian , which explains as ‘hit buttocks of criminal with bamboo whip’. In this view, left hand part of represents a pair of buttocks seated on a stand or similar This seems a reasonable assessment of the seal form, and one which results in the more specific overall meaning for . Later came to be used to represent other words which were homophones or near-homo-phones such as ‘rear (of army)’ (noted by Schuessler) and ‘heavy foundations’. Based on the latter sense, came to be used by further extension for big buildings with heavy foundations such as palaces (Tōdō says this meaning evolved from the Qin Dynasty onwards). In texts in the clerical script, examples can be found of written in what was then a variant form, i.e. 殿 ; over time, this came to be the norm for this graph. Note: 殳 has 又 2003 ‘hand’ holding 几 , a very stylized version of what in OBI occur-rences of 殳 is a depiction of halberd or similar.

Distinguished in shape from 升 at least from seal stage, eventually resulting in two quite distinct forms. By extension, 斗 came to denote a unit of measure – in modern Japan, ca.18 litres (cf. 升 ca.1.8 liters). Other senses such as ‘Big Dipper’ (constellation name) may be seen as loan usages.

Has’water’ 氵 / 水 42 (or ‘river’), with 度 377 (‘degree, times’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cross, traverse’ (Katō says ‘cross from one edge to the other’), thus ‘cross water/river’. Ogawa prefers to treat 度 here as both semantic and phonetic, based on its initial sense of ‘measure with hand’, whereby an object was measured by moving the hand across it, hence the sense ‘crossing’.

Ogawa, however, takes 兆 here as both semantic and phonetic with a meaning ‘move away’, but this seems a rather extreme interpretation of the original meaning of 兆 ‘sign, omen’, presumably based on a perception of motion when a crack is formed.

Has 冫 401 ‘ice’, with 東 201 (‘east’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘pile up, accumulate’, thus ‘become covered with thick ice’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘penetrate, pass through’, giving ‘(thick) ice forms everywhere’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘form together’, giving ‘ice solidifies/forms’ (Katō).

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 兆 573 (‘sign, omen’, initially pictograph of cracks formed on turtle shell or similar in divination), the latter element taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘tree with fruit stones which split in two’, i.e. ‘peach’ (Ogawa, Tōdō). Alternatively, 兆 is treated here by Katō just as phonetic, with associated sense ‘beginning’, giving ‘tree with fruit used at beginning of pregnancy’, reflecting the popularity of this fruit in ancient times among pregnant women and an association with procreation. (Cf. the Japanese legend of Momotarō, the Peach Boy.) OT1968:506; TA1965:243-4; KJ1970:703.	A PEACH TREE IS AN OMEN	images/Chapter7_img_1048.jpg

Has 辶 85 ‘move’, with 秀 1451 (‘excellent’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘project, stick out’, considered to give ‘walk out in front of others’ or ‘leap up’ or ‘go past’ and by extension ‘penetrate’ (Katō), or ii] ‘dance’, giving ‘dance up’, and as loan usage ‘go, pass through; be transparent’ (Ogawa). ‘Leading’ may also suggest clearing the way.

Has 忄 164 ‘heart, feelings’, with 卓 1675 (‘table; excel’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘feel pain’, giving ‘the heart feels pain’ (Katō). Alternatively, the associated sense of 卓 is taken as ‘come out’, giving ‘sadness which leaves one feeling exhausted’ (Ogawa); the basis for Ogawa’s very specific meaning here is not made clear.

盗	TŌ, nusu	steal	L2	1783	11	盗用 [TŌYŌ] - appropriation; 強盗 [GŌTŌ] - robbery; 盗人 [nusubito*] - thief	Seal ; traditional 盜 . Consists of CO ‘drool saliva’ (see Note below), combined with 皿 300 ‘bowl, dish’, interpreted in one view as giving ‘drool saliva over bowl of food, wanting to take it’ (Mizukami, Katō); by extension, ‘(quietly) take, steal’. Ogawa interprets the original sense of 盜 slightly differently as ‘look at food in another’s bowl and feel envious’, but still arrives at the same extended sense as above. Mizukami lists proposed OBI and bronze equivalents for 盗 . Note: is comprised of 氵 ‘water, liquid’, combined with 欠 496 (originally, depiction of person with mouth wide open; ‘lack; gap’), hence the meaning ‘drool saliva’. MS1995:v2:906-7; KJ1970:669; OT1968:532. We suggest taking the modern upper part of 1783 as ‘next’ 次 308.	STEAL A BOWL NEXT	images/Chapter7_img_1050.jpg; images/531.jpg; images/531.jpg
陶	TŌ	porcelain, train, pottery, happy	L1	1784	11	陶器 [TŌKI] - ceramic ware; 陶然 [TŌZEN] - happily drunk; 陶冶 [TŌYA] - training, education	Seal . Consists of 阜 / 阝 262 ‘hill, piled-up earth’, with 匋 (‘bake earthenware’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘(pile up) hill/mountain on top of a hill/mountain’, giving overall sense ‘piled-up hills’ (Ogawa) or ‘name of double-layered mountain’ (Katō). Alternatively, 匋 is taken with associated sense ‘spread evenly’, giving overall meaning for 陶 as ‘pound piled-up earth and make firm’ (Tōdō). Use of 陶 in the sense ‘earthenware, pottery’ appears to be a loan use. It is unclear as to the acquisition of very minor meanings, namely ‘educate, train’ (which may be an extended meaning to train potters) and ‘happy’. (See example words.) Note: 匋 is comprised of 缶 1141 ‘(earthenware) pot’, combined with 勹 611 ‘enclose’; the latter element is taken to be an abbreviation for i] 炮 NJK ‘(lightly) roast’, giving the overall meaning ‘bake earthenware; earthenware’ (noted in Mizukami), or ii] as meaning ‘spread evenly all across mold’, giving ‘knead evenly and make earthenware’ (Tōdō). MS1995:v1:150-51,144-6; OT1968:1070; KJ1970:667-8; TA1965:179-83. We suggest taking 缶 as ‘pot’, 勹 as ‘enclosed’, and 阝 as ‘piled up earth’.

塔	TŌ	tower, monument	L2	1785	12	石塔 [SEKITŌ] - tombstone; 卒塔婆 [SOTŌBA*] - stupa; 五重塔 [GOJŪTŌ] - five-storied pagoda	Seal ; a late graph (later version of Shuowen ). This graph appears to have been devised in the course of the monumental task of translating the Buddhist canon from Sanskrit into Chinese. As part of this process, many Sanskrit Buddhist terms were carried across into Chinese as loanwords by adapting them to the sound system of Chinese, very often also with abbreviation of the original Sanskrit. In this case, Sanskrit stūpa (‘Buddhist shrine’) was reduced to just one syllable and represented by 塔 , consisting of 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, with 荅 (CO, original meaning ‘red beans’) as phonetic to represent the Chinese approximation of the Sanskrit syllable tū in stūpa . Note: according to Katō, these Buddhist shrines were originally built using stone, tiles, and earth, which would help explain use of 土 as the determinative in 塔 , but he suggests there was also a semantic link between 塔 and 堂 584 ‘hall, temple’ on the one hand and 墳 1930 ‘mound, burial mound’ on the other. As is often the case, once loanwords have been adopted into a language, their meaning can change; in this case, changing to encompass a different shape such as a pagoda, and the use of wood as one of the construction materials. KJ1970:666-7; SS1984:647,645; OT1968:221. We suggest taking 荅 as 艹 53 ‘plant’, and 合 134 ‘join, put together’, along with 土 ‘earth’ 64.

Consists of 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, combined with 東 201 (‘east’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pierce, penetrate’, giving ‘ridgepole which extends to the roof ridgebeam’ (Ogawa), or ‘framework timber which extends across to (framework) extremity’ (Tōdō).

Consists of 58 ‘bamboo’, combined with 同 204 (‘same’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘penetrate, pierce; hollow’, giving ‘bamboo tube (with joint obstructions removed)’. Katō prefers to take it as ‘flute’, though this is probably a specialized sense. OT1968:751; TA1965:286-9; AS2007:499-500; KJ1970:73.

The graph 踏 is a popular equivalent of later origin which rose to predominance. The seal form consists of 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, combined with 𦐇 (CO; later replaced by 沓 ) (see Notes below) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘accumulate’, giving ‘accumulate stepping action, tread/trample on’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘attach’, giving ‘foot is firmly planted on the ground’, i.e. ‘tread, stamp’ (Katō). Note 1: 𦐇 is defined in Shuowen as ‘fly vigorously’, i.e. fly with vigorous wing movements. Gu, though, maintains that the original meaning is rather ‘wings spread ready for flight’. Note 2: the seal form of 沓 shows that the lower element is not 日 66 ‘sun, day’, but 曰 1048 ‘speak’, which combines with 水 42 ‘water’, giving ‘talk eloquently’, i.e. words like flowing water.

Has 言 118 ‘words’ (here ‘written’), with 朕 1731 (royal ‘We’), as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘succeed’ (Ogawa) or ii] ‘write’ (Katō), thus ‘succeed in copying written text’.

Has 鬥 , a determinative (not to be confused with 門 231 ‘gate’) OBI form of which shows two people (or possibly two beasts) facing each other or locked in fighting), with 斲 (CO, ‘cut tree with ax’; see Note below) taken either as i] semantic and phonetic (‘cut’) &gt; ‘fight’ (Ogawa), or ii] phonetic with associated sense ‘hit’. Later, determinative changed from 鬥 to 門 ‘gate’ (seemingly a common transition in clerical script; also, 斲 was replaced by as phonetic (same associated sense), probably at block script stage. Note: 斲 has 斤 1233 ‘ax’, with (CO; ‘large wine vessel’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘cut, strike, shave off’ (Mizukami). originally (seal form) shows wine vessel in profile.

Consists of 馬 210 ‘horse’, combined with 朕 1731 (the royal ‘We’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘take over, succeed to’, giving an original meaning ‘relay horse, post horse’, with ‘climb, rise up’ as a loan usage (Ogawa), or ii] ‘leap, climb’, giving ‘horse leaps up’, then generalized to ‘rise, leap’ (Katō, Tōdō).

Has 氵/水 42 ‘water’, with 同 204 (‘same’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘pass through’, giving ‘water passes through’, and by extension ‘pierce’ (Ogawa, Tōdō); with this interpretation, ‘cavity, hollow’ can perhaps be seen as a further extended sense based on the action of erosion by flowing water. Alternatively, 同 is taken here with associated sense ‘tube, hollow’, giving ‘cave where water has entered deep into’ (Shirakawa). OT1968:576; TA1965:286-9; SS1984:655.

Consists of 目 76 ‘eye’, combined with 叔 1466 (‘uncle’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘urge, apply pressure’, giving ‘watch over work of others’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘stop, bring to rest’, giving ‘bring eyes to rest and watch, watch over’ (Katō).

In either interpretation, ‘sincere’ and ‘serious’ are taken as loan usages. On a cultural note, the two components bamboo and horse, pronounced chikuba , refer to a toddler’s wooden horse, and the term chikuba no tomo 竹 馬 の 友 (now rather dated) means ‘a friend from early childhood’.

Consists of 頁 ‘head’ (see 103), combined with 屯 (‘camp’ 1806) as phonetic with associated sense ‘come up against, come to a halt’, giving ‘bow head to the ground’. Other meanings such as ‘sudden’ are loan usages. OT1968:1102; SS1984:665. As with 1806, we suggest taking 屯 as ‘strange hair’ 毛 230.

Shuowen denotes this as a type of fruit tree, possibly a variety of apple. The change to the shape with 大 56 ‘big’ as top element instead of 木 seems to have become established at clerical script stage. Interrogative senses such as ‘how?’ should be seen as loan usages. Gu alone, it seems, proposes an OBI equivalent. DJ2009:v2:449; OT1968:247; SS1984:666; SK1984:192; WD1974:536; GY2008:584-5.

Several scholars take 迷 as phonetic (Ogawa, Shirakawa; associated sense unclear), but another (Gu) puts forward a credible analysis by treating 迷 as both semantic and phonetic in function, giving ‘word which perplexes’, i.e. ‘secret word, slang’.

Has 車 33 ‘vehicle’, with 而 (‘beard’: see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘soft’, giving ‘vehicle with wheels wrapped with reeds to soften vibrations’ &gt; ‘soft’. Examples of 軟 are found in clerical script; the element 欠 may have evolved from a cursivized form of 而 . Note: 11 th century Jiyun dictionary has 耎 (’weak body’) as phonetic instead of 而 , giving the variant form 輭 . DJ2009:v3:1181; T1968:982; KJ1970:748,633; SK1984:699: FC1974:v2:1787-9.

One view takes 尸 as ‘person slumped/lying down, corpse’ 256, but here ‘lame person’, with 匕 (‘bent leg/ladle’ [see Appendix]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stop’, giving ‘lame person stops’ (Katō). In another view, 尸 is taken as meaning just ‘person’, with 匕 as semantic, serving as abbreviation of 比 792 (originally, depiction of two people lined up; ‘compare’), giving ‘line up’ (Tōdō). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes 尼 as depicting one person leaning against another, giving ‘intimate’. The meaning ‘nun’ reflects the use of 尼 for its sound value to write the final syllable of a loanword deriving from Sanskrit bhiksunī ‘nun’. KJ1970:694; TA1965:759-61; SS1984:668-9.

Seal form has NJK 黍 ‘millet’, with 占 1598 (‘divination’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘stick/adhere’ &gt; ‘sticky millet’. Later (unclear when), the determinative 米 220 ‘rice’ was sometimes used in this graph in place of 黍 , resulting in 粘 , though this was long regarded as a popular equivalent: Kangxi zidian still treats 粘 as a popular form of 黏 . ‘Sticky/glutinous’ is a generalized sense.

Seal form has 女 37 ‘woman’, with (‘brain’, later written 腦 964), taken in one view as abbreviation for 匘 ‘brain matter, brain’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘pain’, giving ‘woman feels pain in heart’ (Katō). In another view, is taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend softly, soft but circuitous’, giving ‘something that persists in the mind and won’t go away’ (Tōdō). The associated sense of here is alternatively taken as ‘be related, surround’, giving ‘bad feelings persist’, and hence ‘be distressed’ (Ogawa). Later (unclear when), the determinative 忄/心 164 ‘heart, mind’ was sometimes substituted for 女 ; Kangxi zidian lists both forms as separate entries. In modern times 忄 became the dominant determinative; the earliest Jōyō kanji List (promulgated 1923) has 惱 . TA1965:249-50; KJ1970:674; OT1968:373.

Has 氵 42 ‘liquid’, with 農 386 (‘farming’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘abundant’ (Katō), or ii] ‘wet’ (Ogawa), both giving ‘abundant dew’ ( 濃 often used in this sense in Chinese classics). Katō treats ‘thick, abundant’ as extended sense and ‘strong (flavor)’ as further extended sense. KJ1970:739; OT1968:611.	RICH LIQUIDS AID FARMING	images/Chapter7_img_1105.jpg

Has 扌 34 ‘hand’, with NJK 巴 (now ‘spiral’, but originally either ‘snake’ [Gu, Tōdō] or ‘handle’ [Shirakawa]) with associated sense in one view as ‘grasp,’ thus ‘seize with hand’ (Ogawa, Gu). In another interpretation, associated sense of 巴 here is taken as ‘adhere evenly and thinly’, thus ‘apply hand flat against’, but this gives slightly different hand action and meaning, as Tōdō acknowledges. Use as a counter meaning ‘armful, bundle’ is extended sense. OT1968:404; GY2008:411; MS1995:v1:432-3; TA1965:435-8. Take 巴 as snake.	HAND GRASPS SNAKE	images/Chapter7_img_1106.jpg

The seal form consists of 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, combined with 否 972 (‘no, deny’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘make to curve’, giving ‘vessel/receptacle made by making wood curve’, specifically here ‘wine cup’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, the associated sense is taken as ‘divide up’, giving ‘wooden item for dividing up wine’ (Katō; Mizukami regards this latter interpretation as similarly meaning ‘wine cup’). At the clerical script stage, 否 as phonetic was sometimes replaced by 不 600 (‘not’), with the same associated sense. DJ2009:v2:477; OT1968:495; KJ1970:795; MS1995:v1:670-71; SK1984:398.

Has 土 64 ‘ground’, with CO 咅 (‘spit’, ‘split’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘add to, pile up’ (Shirakawa says ‘swell’), thus ‘add more soil’. Originally, 培 was interchangeable with 陪 1840, meaning ‘increase, add to’ (later meaning of 陪 : ‘attend, accompany’), but over time, the two graphs came to be distinguished. 培 came to be associated with growing things, thus ‘grow, cultivate’. Note: In one view, 咅 has 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, with top element which is not 立 77 ‘stand’ but a variant of 不 600 ‘not’, serving as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘spit in refusal’, or just ‘spit’ (Katō, Tōdō). Shirakawa takes 咅 as originally depicting ripe fruit about to split. OT1968:219,178; KJ1970:758; TA1965:158; SS1984:686,798. Take 立 as ‘stand’, 口 ‘hole’.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with 白 69 (‘white’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘big’ or ‘leader, boss’, giving ‘one who becomes leader’ (Katō, Ogawa). Another view takes the associated sense of 白 as ‘senior male’, giving ‘eldest among brothers’, or ‘uncle older than one’s father’, and by extension ‘leader of various lords’ (Tōdō). For latter sense, ‘count’ is a conventional translation-equivalent; Schuessler suggests ‘earl’ also. KJ1970:773; OT1968:55; TA1965:432-4; AS2007:169.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, with 白 69 (‘white’) with associated sense taken as i] ‘stop’, thus ‘boat stops’ (Katō), or ii] ‘come up close’, thus ‘water’s edge where boat stops’ (Ogawa).

Note: right-hand part of the phonetic 溥 here is 尃 , not to be confused with similarly-shaped 専 925 (‘exclusive, sole’), of which the traditional form 專 is a little more distinctive in shape. 溥 has 氵 42 ‘water’ with 尃 , the latter taken in one view as ‘field of plant seedlings’, and by extension ‘plant out seedlings’; sense then generalized to ‘spread’ (Gu), though Shirakawa sees it as sapling roots being trussed up/bound. GY2008:1653,1012; KJ1970:772-3; OT1968:874; MS1995:v1:256-8,394-5; SS1984:693; AS2007:173. Suggest using ‘sole,’ 専 (but ‘not quite right’/‘almost’) to represent 尃 , plus water 氵 and plants 艹 .

漠	BAKU	vague, vast, desert	L1	1850	13	漠然 [BAKUZEN] - vague; 漠々 [BAKUBAKU] - vast, vague; 砂漠 [SABAKU] - desert	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 氵 42 ‘water’, with 莫 ‘not’ (and other negative senses)’ (original way of writing 暮 982 ‘sunset’, q.v.), taken in one view (Gu) as semantic and phonetic, thus ‘lack of water’ and hence ‘desert’. In another view 莫 is taken as phonetic only with associated sense ‘vast, expansive’ (Shirakawa), though combined with 氵 this would seemingly lead to a meaning opposite to that proposed by Gu. GY2008:1652; SS1984:693; WD1974:525-6. Take as water 氵 42, plants 艹 53, ‘sun’ 日 66, and ‘big’ 大 56.	IN VAST DESERT, BIG PLANTS NEED SUN AND WATER	images/Chapter7_img_1128.jpg

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, with 尃 (CO, ‘field of plant seedlings’, or ‘truss up sapling roots’; see 1849 Note). 尃 is treated as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘stick, attach’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘bind’ (Shirakawa, Gu), both giving overall meaning ‘bind with thread/cord’. Note: if 尃 is seen as ‘truss up sapling roots’, its role here is both semantic and phonetic. OT1968:788; SS1984:693; GY2008:1674. As in 1849 (q.v.) take ‘almost sole’.

Has 火 8 ‘fire’, with 暴 814 (‘violence’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘flames fly’, giving ‘fireworks burst open’ (Ogawa). In similar vein, Tōdō tends towards ‘sparks (from fire) fly’ as the original associated sense, and sees ‘burn and burst open’ as the extended meaning. Another view sees 暴 as onomatopoeic, and the graph 爆 is taken as representing sound of such things as firewood or bamboo crackling or popping while burning (Katō; Shirakawa is also of this view). By extension, ‘explode’. OT1968:629; TA1965:278; KJ1970:777-8; SS1984:694.	FIRE CAUSES VIOLENT EXPLOSION	images/Chapter7_img_1130.jpg

Has 58 ‘bamboo’, with 314 者 / 者 ‘person’. 者 is taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘pick up’, giving ‘(pieces of) bamboo for picking up food’ (Katō, Ogawa). Gu, however, takes 者 as both semantic and phonetic, linking it to the original meaning indicated by the bronze form, which has firewood projecting up out of a container. Gu thus takes the original meaning of 箸 as ‘bamboo fire brand/torch’, and treats the meaning ‘chopsticks’ given in Shuowen as an extended sense. In modern times the dot has tended to disappear, as is the case with 者 . OT1968:756; KJ1970:495; GY2008:1727.	PERSON HAS BAMBOO CHOPSTICKS	images/Chapter7_img_1131.jpg; images/60e.jpg

Has 髟 ‘long hair’ (NJK; see Note 1 below), with 犮 (CO, ‘dog leaps up’ [Ogawa] or ‘dog wags tail’ [Katō]; see Note 2 below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘grow, emerge’, giving ‘hair grows’(Ogawa, Katō), or ii] ‘cover’, giving ‘hair covering the head’ (Tōdō). Mizukami also notes a view that may be termed a variation of i] above, with associated sense ‘spring up, open in random way’, giving ‘hair which springs up in random way’. Mizukami also lists proposed bronze equivalents. Note 1: 髟 is taken as left hand side 镸 189 ‘long hair/person with long hair’, combined with 彡 115 as meaning ‘complete, full/abundant’, giving ‘hair is full/abundant’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa). Note 2: Traditional form of 髪 has 犮 as lower element, now regularized in shape in a way that corresponds to 友 234 (‘friend’). MS1995:v2:1476-8; OT1968:1136; KJ1970:370; SS1984:725; AS2007:166.

It is unclear as to how other meanings came about. Note 1: traditional form of 抜 has 犮 as right-hand element, now regularized in shape in a way which corresponds to 友 234 (‘friend’). Note 2: in early Chinese writing, the causative was often left unmarked, needing to be inferred from context. Take 友 as ‘friend’. KJ1970:371; OT1968:404; TA1968:647-51.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with / 半 214 (‘half’) serving as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘corpulent’, giving ‘corpulent/obese person’ (Katō), or – in similar vein – ii] ‘spread out’, giving ‘large person’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘divide in two’, giving ‘one (person) who is half of a pair’ (Tōdō’s alternative interpretation), or iv] ‘link together’, giving ‘one who accompanies’ (Ogawa). In the case of i] and ii] above, ‘accompany’ represents a loan usage. KJ1970:785; TA1965:654-8,647-52; OT1968:56.

Has 阝 262 ‘hill, mound’, with 反 393 (‘oppose, anti-’) as phonetic with associated sense usually taken as ‘sloping, inclined’, giving ‘slope’. Shirakawa offers an alternative minority view, taking the associated sense as ‘scramble up’, and relates the overall meaning to a ladder providing a link with the deities. 坂 394, a variant form of later provenance which substitutes 土 64 ‘earth, ground’ as determinative, is listed in the 11 th century Jiyun dictionary.

般	HAN	all, carry, general	L2	1867	10	一般 [IPPAN] - general(ly); 全般 [ZENPAN] - the whole; 万般 [BANPAN] - all, everything	OBI ; seal . Views diverge. One treats as 攴 ‘hit with whip/stick’ 112, with a second element similar in shape to 井 1575 (‘well’, taken as ‘frame to enclose soil’, thus ‘flatten earth and make firm’ (Ogawa). In this view, senses such as ‘move’ are seen as loan uses. Another view (Katō) accepts variation in shape in OBI and bronze forms, but still feels that appropriate interpretation is 舟 1450 ‘boat’, combined with 殳 170, a determinative usually meaning ‘strike with weapon’. Originally, 殳 depicts hand holding a weapon (possibly halberd), but is taken here by Katō as pole used to propel boat, giving overall meaning ‘move boat round, go round by boat’; ‘move, transport, carry’ may be taken as extended senses in this analysis. Another view has the element later rendered as 舟 as meaning 盤 1877 ‘bowl’, and together with 殳 in sense ‘hit with stick’ is taken as ‘make a bowl’ (Gu; Shirakawa also notes as possible interpretation).

Originally written 辬 , comprising 文 72 ‘pattern’, with 辡 (‘be in dispute’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘mix’, giving ‘mottled pattern/colors’. Later, the phonetic element was changed from 辡 to 玨 (shortened form of 珏 (‘two sets of jade discs’: see 15). Note: 辡 has 辛 1535 (‘sharp’) duplicated; the original meaning of 辛 being ‘large tattooing needle’, used on foreheads of criminals and slaves to mark ownership. Shuowen defines 辡 as ‘criminals in dispute’. Distinguish from 班 970. GY2008:1360; ZY2009:v3:729,v4:1338; OT1968:447.

Has 頁 103 ‘head’, with 火 8 ‘fire’. In one analysis the 火 element is taken as ‘fever’, giving ‘have fever and headache’, and by extension ‘suffer, trouble’ (Ogawa). Another scholar (Tōdō) also takes original meaning as ‘have fever and headache’, following the explanation in Shuowen , but treats as coming within a word-family meaning ‘be overturned, collapse’, making ‘troublesome’ an extended sense.

It consists of 頁 103 ‘head’, combined with 分 218 (‘divide’) as a phonetic with an associated sense ‘fat, swollen’, thus giving the original meaning ‘large head’. ‘Divide, distribute’ are loan uses. KJ1970:790; OT1968:1103; TA1965:730-32. We suggest taking 頁 ‘head’ as ‘mind’ for one mnemonic, and the literal collection of heads after a battle for another mnemonic. (In the early days of the samurai, heads were indeed seen as trophies, so the more heads one could take the greater one’s reputation. However, the heads were supposed to be cut off a living adversary, but many warriors took the easy way and decapitated corpses. Presently sophisticated techniques were put in place to establish whether the head was cut off a living person or a corpse, and in the latter case it was seen as shameful.)

Consists of 車 33 ‘vehicle’, combined with 笵 (CO, ‘law, pattern’; see Note below) in an abbreviated form as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘cook ritual meat’, giving ‘conduct meat-cooking ritual to purify vehicle’ (Katō), or ii] ‘violate’, giving ‘as purificatory act run over dog and smear vehicle wheels with blood’ (Ogawa); Tōdō also favors the latter overall meaning. This ritual was probably performed when setting out on an important trip or mission. While the original meaning for 範 noted here may seem bizarre from a modern perspective, we should bear in mind that superstition was a very powerful force in ancient times and indeed until the beginnings of modern science started to dispel persistent beliefs held regarding the supernatural. ‘Framework, model’ and related meanings are loan use for 範 . Note: the meaning ‘law, pattern’ for 笵 is noted in Shuowen . This appears to be an extended sense deriving from an original meaning ‘bamboo writing tablet’. DJ2009:v2:379; KJ1970:789; OT1968:986; TA1965:868-71. We suggest taking the lower right element as slumped person.

Consists of 艹 53 ‘plants’, combined with 潘 (CO, ‘cloudy water in which rice has been washed’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hedge, screen, fence’, giving overall meaning ‘hedge, screen, wall’ around a house or similar. ‘Fief’ appears to be an extended sense, and ‘clan’ a further extension, and the meanings ‘hedge, screen, wall’ are now effectively defunct. Note: 潘 comprises 氵 42 ‘water’ with 番 215 (‘number’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘white’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘spread out in circular shape’ (this and i] are both noted in Mizukami), either way giving ‘cloudy water in which rice has been washed’ (associated sense ii] here derives from the circular motion of water when rice or similar is washed in a container).

Consists in one view of 虫 60 ‘insect, snake’ used pejoratively, combined with (CO, ‘tangled thread’ or ‘unravel tangled thread’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘be in disorder/disarray’, giving original meaning ‘ethnic group in ancient southern China who worshipped snakes’ (Ogawa). In another analysis (Katō), is treated as representing an outsider clan name derived from the name of the ancestral deity (fire deity) of the ancient state of Chu ( 楚 ); again, 虫 is considered to have been incorporated pejoratively. Both analyses treat ‘outsiders, barbarians’ as an extended use of 蠻 . Mizukami lists proposed bronze equivalents also. Note: is comprised of 絲 ‘fine thread’ (later written in abbreviated form as 糸 29 ‘thread’), with 言 118 (‘words; speak’). Confusingly, depending on the associated sense, overall meaning is taken as either ‘unravel tangled thread’, or ‘thread becomes tangled’. Both interpretations, listed in Mizukami, reflect ambivalence regarding the meaning of already at the time of compilation of Shuowen .

These two proposed etymologies are to some extent complementary, as Katō notes the first use of such upright stones was as a device to see the length of shadows from the sun. Later, such stones were used to help lower coffins on ropes down into the ground (Shirakawa notes this was facilitated by holes bored in the stones), and from that practice there also developed the custom (Han onwards) of recording details of the deceased onto the stones.

Has 罒 ( 网 ) 570 ‘net’, with 能 787 (‘ability’, see also ‘bear’ 熊 1252) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘withdraw’, thus original meaning ‘remove a net’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘withdraw, abandon’, thus ‘abandon net previously set up’ (Katō). However, Shirakawa takes 能 here as showing wild animal caught in net, thus meanings such as ‘tire’ and ‘give up’, but this is at odds with his separate analysis of 能 as an independent graph, for which he takes the original meaning as ‘aquatic insect’. OT1968:796; KJ1970:690-91; SS1984:715,675. We suggest taking 能 as a bear.	CEASE WORK AND GO, LEAVING BEAR IN NET	images/563a.jpg

Seal form has 卩 41 ‘kneeling figure’, with what in one view is treated as 桼 (‘sap, resin’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend’, thus ‘joint for bending leg’, i.e. ‘knee’ (Katō, Gu; see Note below). Shuowen has 厀 ; later, 月 209 ‘flesh, body’ came to be used as determinative in place of 卩 , hence the more familiar 膝. At clerical script stage examples of this graph close in shape to 膝 are found. Note: Katō sees 卩 as a distortion of the seal shape (see right side of seal form above). He also sees 卩 as the original graph for ‘knee’, and 厀 to be – unusually – a form with 桼 added later as phonetic. Ogawa regards not 桼 but the similarly-shaped NJK 黍 (‘millet’) as the phonetic (same associated sense), though in the seal shape of 厀 it seems more like 桼 .

Ogawa takes 苗 here as phonetic, serving as onomatopoeic for the miaowing sound made by a cat; Late Han period pronunciation of 貓 was mau (Schuessler). The form with 犭 (variant of 犬 19 in compound graphs, meaning dog or other creature/beast perceived as approximating to a dog in some way) in place of 豸 appears to be of late origin; this probably evolved as a popular form, but eventually was adopted as standard in the modern period.

怖	FU, kowa	fear, afraid	L2	1906	8	恐怖症 [KYŌFUSHŌ] - phobia; 恐怖 [KYŌFU] - fear; 畏怖 [IFU] - dread, awe	Seal ( 悑 ) . Shuowen has 悑 as entry heading, with 怖 noted as alternative. Has 忄 164 ‘heart’, with 甫 (NJK; see Note below)/ 布 799 (‘cloth’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘hit,’ giving ‘chest palpitates’/‘be afraid’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘be afraid’ (Katō). Several clerical script occurrences are close in shape to 怖 . Note: Views on 甫 diverge. Usually taken based on early (OBI/bronze) forms as 屮 ‘plant shoot’ with 田 63 ‘field’ &gt; ‘seedling bed, vegetable field, plant seedlings’ (Ogawa, Tōdō, Gu; Shirakawa broadly agrees). Mizukami notes different view, taking as 父 216 (orig hand holding ax; loan use for ‘father’) over 用 235 ‘use’ (loan meaning), but early forms suggest consensus view is better. Either way, ‘beginning, first’ is seen as an extended sense, indicating beginning stage of horticulture or construction work.

Analysis iii] leads most directly to ‘be attached, attach’ as an extended sense. OT1968:1065; KJ1970:823; MS1995:v2:1392-3; SS1984:739.	ONE GETS ATTACHED TO HILLY MOUNDS	images/Chapter7_img_1202.jpg

Has 走 179 ‘run’, with 卜 (‘perform divination’, see 96/1598) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘stick, adhere, get near to’, giving ‘hastily go and reach/arrive’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘announce’, giving ‘run and announce’, or – according to Qiu – ‘run and announce somebody’s death’. This latter meaning later came to be represented by 訃 1909, while 赴 came to be used in general senses such as ‘proceed’. Mizukami lists a proposed OBI equivalent. OT1968:966; KJ1970:820; QX2000:333.

Has 日 66 ‘sun, day’, with 竝 (traditional form of 並 977 ‘row, line’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘thin, faint’, thus ‘sunlight is faint’ (Katō) or ii] ‘spread out’, thus ‘sunlight extends everywhere’ (Ogawa), and ‘widely, generally’ as an extended sense. The latter view is supported by Schuessler, who details a relevant word-family in early Chinese for the phonetic element 竝 here which encompasses ‘spread out, be vast; extensively’.

Has 肉 209 ‘meat, flesh, body’ with 府 603 (‘govt office’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘swollen and disordered’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘decay’ (Katō), both giving ‘meat breaks down, goes bad’.

敷	FU, shi	spread, lay	L1	1915	15	敷設 [FUSETSU] - laying; 敷物 [shikimono] - rug; 屋敷 [yashiki] - mansion, residence	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 攴 / 攵 112 ‘beat with stick’, with CO 尃 593 ‘spread out the fingers’ (see Note below) as semantic and phonetic (Ogawa; alternatively, Katō treats as phonetic only, with generalized meaning ‘spread out’ as associated sense), giving ‘beat (something) with stick to spread it out’. Left-hand element of 敷 is a variant of 尃 ; forms close to 敷 can be found at clerical script stage. Note: 尃 comprises 寸 920 ‘hand’, with 甫 (probable original meaning: ‘seedling bed, vegetable field’; see 1906 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘spread the fingers (to measure)’, giving ‘spread the four fingers (to measure)’. OT1968:443; MS1995:582-3; KJ1970:857; SK1984:352. Take left side as variant of 専 925 ‘exclusive’.	BEAT A VARIED EXCLUSIVE SPREAD AND LAY IT OUT	images/Chapter7_img_1210.jpg
膚	FU, hada	skin	L2	1916	15	皮膚炎 [HIFUEN] - dermatitis; 皮膚 [HIFU] - skin; 鮫膚 [samehada] - shagreen, dry skin	Seal ( 臚 ) . Shuowen has 臚 as the entry heading, and notes 膚 as variant. 臚 consists of 月 / 肉 209 ‘flesh, meat, body’, with 盧 (CO, interpretations of meaning vary; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘spread, cover’, giving ‘flesh/that which covers surface of the body’, i.e. ‘skin’. At the clerical script stage, a significant change in shape took place, with left-hand 月 / 肉 commonly omitted and the lower element changed to 胃 447 ‘stomach’ (possibly as just a graphic variant). Note: occurrent OBI and bronze shapes of 盧 vary, and interpretations vary in consequence. Mizukami and Katō are agreed, though, that 盧 and 𧆨 are in essence one and the same graph, 皿 300 (‘bowl’) being an addition in some bronze occurrences. Lower element originally had not 田 63 ‘field’, but an element of roughly similar shape taken to represent a wine container; the upper element in some occurrences is 虍 (originally, pictograph of tiger’s head – an abbreviation of the fuller form 虎 1301 ‘tiger’) serving as phonetic with associated sense ‘bend, round, concave’. In other occurrences the upper element is seen as an inverted container, and so straining wine is taken to be one part of the meaning. The overall meaning is accordingly taken by Mizukami and Katō to be ‘round wine container made of willow for strained wine’. Gu, alternatively, interprets the graph as meaning ‘stove’. MS1995:v2:1082-3,910-11,1138-9,1140-41; KJ1970:824,898-9; DJ2009:v2:344; OT1968:827; SK1984:601. We suggest taking the lower part of the modern graph as 胃 447 ‘stomach, belly’.

Consists of 言 118 ‘words; speak’ (here best taken as ‘written words, text’), combined with 普 1913 (‘widely, generally’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put in order, arrange’, giving ‘documents with material in set order’. Used for a range of document types such as genealogies, chronological lists, and musical scores. SS1984:744; OT1968:944.	GENEALOGY IS WIDELY SPOKEN OF	images/Chapter7_img_1214.jpg

Has 巾 1232 ‘piece of cloth’, with 畐 409 (‘bulbous/full wine jar’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘swollen’, thus ‘cloth swollen sideways, width’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘full’ or ‘distance between’, thus ‘distance from left to right, width’ (Katō).

Has 覀 ‘stopper, cover’ (originally a pictograph; not a variant of similarly-shaped 西 169 ‘west’), combined with 復 803 (‘again, repeat’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘wrap, envelop’, giving ‘cover’. ‘Overturn’ is a loan usage. MS1995:v2:1176-7; OT1968:913. We suggest taking 覀 as ‘west’.	WEST OVERTURNED AGAIN! MUST BE COVER STORY!	images/Chapter7_img_1224.jpg

Has 扌 34 ’hand’, with 弗 (NJK, ‘straighten’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘suddenly remove’, giving ‘push aside with the hand’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘dirt’, giving ‘remove dirt by hand’ (Katō). Note: the OBI form of 弗 is taken by Gu as depicting bent arrows being straightened using cord wrapped round them, while Shirakawa takes it to be cord wrapped round saplings to bind and keep them straight. 弗 was later borrowed as a convenient way of representing a grammatical function word of negative meaning. In older Japanese texts, 弗 is sometimes found used again as a loan – in this case on the basis of shape – for DORU ‘dollar’. OT1968:401; KJ1970:832; GY2008:598; SS1984:202.

Has 氵 42 ‘water’, and 弗 (‘straighten’; see 1925 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge suddenly, gush out’, giving ‘water gushes out’. Katō sees ‘boil’ as loan usage. The change of 弗 to ム , though used in 拂 / 払 1925, was judged too radical for this graph in Japan. KJ1970:832; OT1968:568. Suggest winding on sticks.	WATER ‘UNWINDS’ BOUND STICKS WHEN IT BOILS

Has 口 22 ‘mouth/opening’, with 賁 (‘beautiful large shell’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘exhale suddenly’, giving ‘blow out vigorously’ (Ogawa). In similar vein, Shirakawa takes associated sense to be ‘emerge on the outside’, and notes there tends to be some force involved. Katō takes 賁 as onomatopoeic, with overall meaning ‘make a noise with the mouth/through the nose’, and regards ‘gush out, exude’ as loan usage. Note: 賁 is comprised of 貝 10 ‘shell’ combined with 卉 as abbreviation of 奔 1991 (‘run, bustle’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘gush out, swell up’, giving ‘beautiful large shell’ (Mizukami). Schuessler gives the meaning ‘ardent’ for 賁 , and this may be an extended sense. OT1968:196; SS1984:757; KJ1970:833; MS1995:v2:1240-41,v1:304-5; AS2007:160. Take upper right as 3 x ‘ten’ 十 35 = 30.

Has ‘heart, feelings’ 忄 164, with 賁 (see 1929 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘gush, exude’, thus ‘vent one’s anger’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘full’, thus ‘one’s heart is full’ (Katō). Schuessler supports latter, positing semantic range ‘swell’ to ‘full of annoyance’. OT1968:388; KJ1970:833; AS2007:236. Take 賁 as 30 shells.

Has 亻 41 ‘person’, with 幷 (traditional form of 并 NJK ‘put/join together’), giving ‘(two persons) lined up/put together’ (see 1904 Note 1). Katō and some others treat it as variant of 幷 / 并 with 亻 added as determinative, which no doubt is the case (see Note below). The meanings of 并 and 併 are the same (‘join together’), but in modern Japanese texts 併 is used rather than 并 . Note: Mizukami lists proposed OBI equivalent for 併 which lacks 亻 , identical to OBI equivalents for 並 977 ‘row, line’). MS1995:v1:74-5,446-7, v2:980-81; OT1968:61; KJ1970:836-7.

The graph consists of 巾 1232 ‘(piece of) cloth’, combined with 敝 as phonetic with associated sense ‘offer up’, giving ‘cloth for offering’. The meaning was later generalized to ‘gift’, and by further extension to ‘currency’. Prayer offerings to the gods of Shintō shrines include in particular cloth, and rope, along with cut and folded paper strips, the latter typically interwoven into an intricate pattern. It has been a tradition to make offerings on particular occasions, often (at least originally) specific to particular localities, such as in some eastern parts of Japan (and probably elsewhere) there are prayers and offerings to the mountain deities on New Year’s Day, in this particular case bundles of straw being hung in trees. Note: 敝 consists of 攴 / 攵 112 ‘strike, cause to do, force’, combined with , a CO ‘rip, tear’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘tear cloth’; by extension, ‘damaged clothing; be damaged/destroyed’. is comprised of 巾 ‘cloth’, with the four short downward diagonal strokes representing rips or tears.

Katō takes ‘evil, abuse’ as a loan usage; HEI- as a prefix in Japanese (older literary style) meaning ‘my/our’ (humble connotation) is also probably a loan usage. The popular form 弊 , with the erroneous lower element 廾 (‘hands offering up’, see e.g. 1639) as determinative appears to be a development in block script; in clerical script we find another example of a divergent writing, this one still quite close to 獘 in shape, having 大 56 ‘big’ instead of dog 犬 .

OT1968:872; TA1965:658-61; AS2007:164. Take the elements as ‘grass’ 艹 , ‘force, coerce’ 攴 / 攵 (see 112); and as ‘torn bits of cloth’.

Either way it results in seeking to gather, giving a number of extended senses. OT1968:129; TA1965:449-53; KJ1970:775. Take as variant ‘big’ 大 56, ‘grass’ 艹 53, and ‘sun’ 日 66.

Consists of 氵 42 ‘water’, combined with 包 611 ‘envelop, wrap’ as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘that which envelops water surface’, i.e. ‘foam’. Tōdō interprets slightly differently, including in his word-family ‘envelop, swollen up in round fashion’, but with essentially the same overall meaning. TA1965:231-4; OT1968:570; SS1984:786.

Has 山 26 ‘mountain’, with 夆 (‘thrust upwards, revolt; meet, encounter’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sharp point/tip’, thus ‘pointed summit’. Note: 夆 comprises 夂 ‘foot’, a determinative sometimes taken as having the connotation ‘upwards, high’ (Mizukami, Katō), with 丰 (see 1953) ‘luxuriant vegetation; (vegetation) thrusts upwards’ taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘thrust upwards’ (this interpretation noted in Mizukami). KJ1970:862; OT1968:304; TA1965:322; MS1995:v1:284-5. We suggest taking 夂 as ‘sit crosslegged’ and 丰 as telegraph pole (also 1953).

砲	HŌ	gun, cannon	L1	1961	10	砲丸 [HŌGAN] - cannon ball; 鉄砲 [TEPPŌ] - firearms; 大砲 [TAIHŌ] - big gun, cannon	A late, post- Shuowen graph. Originally written 礮 (CO, itself a post- Shuowen graph). 砲 has 石 47 ‘rock/stone’, with 包 611 (‘envelop’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘send flying, hurl’, thus ‘catapult device to hurl rocks a long distance’. Later used for ‘cannon’. 砲 is noted in Kangxi zidian as the popular form of 礮 . ZY2009:v3:857; KJ1970:762; OT1968:711.	ENVELOPED IN STONES FROM CANNON

It consists of 山 26 ‘mountain’, combined with 朋 (originally [OBI], depiction of multiple strings of shell currency; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘break/split in two, be destroyed’, giving ‘mountain crumbles’; meaning then generalized to ‘crumble, be destroyed’. There is a very minor meaning ‘die’ (used of emperors) which is an extended sense. Note: By extension ‘pair of valuable items’, and by further extension ‘friends; throng together’. MS1995:v1:418-9,636-8; KJ1970:860; OT1968:305. Take 朋 as two moons / months 月 18.	MOUNTAIN CRUMBLES IN JUST TWO MONTHS	images/Chapter7_img_1265.jpg
蜂	HŌ, hachi	bee, wasp, hornet	L1	1963	13	蜂蜜 [hachiMITSU] - honey; 蜂起 [HŌKI] - revolt, uprising; 蜂の巣 [hachinosu] - hive, hornets’ nest	Seal ( 蠭 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). The seal form has CO ‘insect (generic)’, with 逢 (‘meet, encounter’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sharp tip’, interpreted in one view as ‘insect with sharp tip’, i.e. ‘bee, wasp’ (Ogawa). Tōdō, though, looks to interpret differently, as referring to a cone-shaped swarm of bees around a queen-bee. In block script, the graph has the same structure but is simplified in shape to 虫 60 ‘insect’, with 夆 as phonetic (same associated sense as explained in 1960 Note: i.e. sharp, point, tip’). Note: 逢 consists of 辶 / 辶 85 ‘walk along a road, go’, with 夆 (‘thrust upwards, revolt; meet’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘come together’, giving original meaning ‘two people approach and meet/encounter each other on a road’ (Mizukami). OT1968:888; TA1965:319-23; MS1995:v2:1296-7; GY2008:1600. As with 1960, we suggest taking 夂 as ‘sit crosslegged’ and 丰 as telegraph pole.

飽	HŌ, a	tire, satiate	L1	1964	13	飽和 [HŌWA] - saturation; 飽食 [HŌSHOKU] - satiation; 飽き性 [akiSHŌ] - fickleness	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional form has the older left-hand equivalent of 飠 , viz. , combined with a right-hand element 包 (traditional form of 包 ‘envelop, wrap’ 611) (see Note below). Consists of 163 ‘food, eat’, with 包 / 包 as semantic and phonetic in its original meaning ‘swell up’, giving ‘stomach grows through eating’, and by extension ‘become satiated, tire’. Note: the element 巳 in 包 – later modified to 己 , giving 包 – originally represented an infant in the womb, not a snake; OBI occurrences of the two are very similar (if not identical in some cases, with meaning distinguished only by context) and hence easily confused.

Has 衣 444 ‘garment’, with a middle element that in seal stage corresponded to 孚 (‘deliver newborn infant’, etc. – see 1911 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘swell up’, thus ‘garment with big exaggerated sleeves’ (Ogawa); Tōdō broadly agrees. 褒 seems to be block script onwards; Kangxi zidian has 襃 . Modern form (1923 Jōyō kanji List onwards) has 保 808 (‘preserve’) sandwiched between ‘split garment’. DJ2009:v2;677; OT1968:908; TA1965:234; SK1984:647.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, with 逢 ‘come together’ (see 1963) as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘join (fabric) with thread’. OT1968:789; TA1965:323. As with 1960 and 1963, we suggest taking 夂 as ‘sit crosslegged’ and 丰 as telegraph pole.	SIT CROSSLEGGED ON TELEGRAPH POLE, SEWING THREADS	images/Chapter7_img_1268.jpg

坊	BŌ	priest, boy, town	L2	1969	7	坊主 [BŌZU*] - priest; 坊や [BŌya] - boy; 坊間 [BŌKAN] - ‘around town’	Seal ; late graph (later version of Shuowen ). Has 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, and 方 223 ‘side, direction, square’. Taken in one view as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘square’, giving ‘square-shaped division/plot of land’ (Ogawa). A different analysis takes 方 as phonetic with associated sense ‘plot of land’ and 土 , giving ‘plot of land’ (Shirakawa); ‘town’ is an extended large-scale sense. Shirakawa notes that 坊 was used to denote plots of land – typically square – in a city divided up in terms of a traditional grid system. In turn, 坊 came to be applied in a Buddhist context for the divisions of space in a temple (including rooms), and the chief priest was known as 坊 主 BŌZU , a term which later came to be used as a general word meaning ‘(Buddhist) priest’; ‘boy’ seems to be a generalized sense deriving from ‘young boy priest’. ‘Town’ is now quite rare as a meaning.

Has 女 37 ‘woman’, with 方 223 (‘side, direction’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘obstruct’ (Ogawa; Tōdō says ‘hold hands out to both sides and obstruct’), giving ‘woman who obstructs’ or ‘one who extends hands to both sides and prevents others from approaching a woman’ (both interpretations are listed in Mizukami). In another analysis, 方 is treated as phonetic with associated sense ‘vilify, calumnify’, giving ‘woman who vilifies others’ (Katō). In either case, sense became generalized and not gender-specific, and with ‘obstruct’ as the principal meaning. Mizukami lists a proposed OBI equivalent.

Has 戸 120 ‘door’, here in the sense ‘building’, combined with 方 223 (‘side’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘side’, giving ‘(small) side rooms in a building’ (of a communal nature). Extended senses include ‘building, house’, and people who live there – specifically, family members, particularly ‘wife’ (Gu). Minor sense ‘tuft, fleece’ may be loan usage.

Has 月 209 ‘meat, body’, with 方 223 (‘side, direction’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘swell up’ (Ogawa), ‘taut and bloated’ (Tōdō), giving ‘grow fat/corpulent’, or ii] ‘white’, giving ‘white flesh’, i.e. ‘fatty tissue’ (second associated sense given by Tōdō).

Has 刂 198 ‘knife/cut’, with 咅 (‘about to split open’, etc.; see 1839 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘be divided into two’ (Ogawa, Tōdō), or ii] ‘open up’ (Katō), either way giving ‘divide, cut up’.OT1968:119; TA1965:158; KJ1970:759; SS1984:798.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, with 方 223 (‘side, direction’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘join together’, giving ‘combine fibers to make thread’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, associated phonetic sense of 方 here is taken to be ‘raise up’, referring to the upward movement of thread in the spinning process (Shirakawa). OT1968:771; SS1984:798-9.

One view has 亻 41 ‘person’ with 旁 (NJK, originally meaning ‘bring two boats alongside each other’, thus ‘person in charge of boats’, i.e. ‘boatman’). ‘Side’ is then seen as extended sense derived from 旁 (Katō). Alternatively, 旁 is taken as meaning ‘everywhere, side’, with 亻 added to indicate meaning of ‘side’ (Ogawa). Schuessler confirms meanings ‘side’ and ‘everywhere’ for 旁 , and ‘side’ may well be the extended sense as Katō suggests, but there is the question of why 亻 ‘person’ would be added to denote the meaning ‘side’. The first analysis seems more persuasive. KJ1970:764; OT1968:77; AS2007:409. Take 旁 as ‘side’ 方 223 and as ‘stand’ 立 77 strangely.

Original graph is taken to be 皃 , showing a person 儿 41 wearing a face mask ( 白 ) (Ogawa, Tōdō). In one view, taken as mask for a deceased person, the mask representing emphasis on outer form or appearance, hence the sense ‘form, appearance’ (Shirakawa). 豸 (1363, wide semantic range including ‘predatory wild beast’ and ‘crawling insect’) is an element added later (Qiu notes that some see this as abbreviation of 豹 [NJK, ‘leopard, panther’]), apparently with a phonetic function. OT1968:951; TA1965:280; SS1984:795-6; QX2000:299; MS1995:v2:1226-9. Take 白 as ‘white’ 69.	PERSON WITH WHITE MASK HAS APPEARANCE OF WILD BEAST	images/Chapter7_img_1287.jpg

Has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, with 某 1973 (‘a certain…’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘look for, try to find’, thus ‘look for the truth in someone’s words’ or ‘seek opinion’ (Mizukami, Katō), or ii] ‘read (someone’s mind)’, thus ‘plan’ (Ogawa). Later the graph acquired a negative connotation. MS1995:v2:1208-9; KJ1970:757; OT1968:939; AS2007:391.	PLOT DEPENDS UPON A CERTAIN WORD – GOOD STRATAGEM	images/Chapter7_img_1289.jpg

Has 頁 103 ‘head’ (here ‘face’), with 夾 ‘on both sides; put between’ (see Note below), giving ‘that which is on both sides of the face’, i.e. ‘cheek(s)’. Note: OBI form for 夾 shows two smaller people standing either side of big person with arms outstretched. Qiu gives original meaning as ‘on two sides’; extended to ‘put between, insert’ (later written 挟 1221, q.v). QX2000:187; SS1984:1100,189; OT1968:246; AS2007:300.

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 卜 96 (‘crack’, ‘divination’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘snap, break’, giving ‘tree bark’. It seems that another word having the same pronunciation in early Chinese meaning ‘as yet untouched/unworked natural tree wood’, once written 樸 (NJK), was sometimes written by substituting 朴 instead. Used in this way, 朴 acquired an extended sense from 樸 , i.e. ‘naïve, unsophisticated, artless’. TA1965:317-9; DJ2009:v2:463,467; GY2008:229-30.

Consists of 手 / 扌 34 ‘hand’, combined with (CO; implement for striking or gouging) as phonetic, here serving as onomatopoeic for the sound of impact against the material concerned. The overall original meaning is ‘hit using the hand’, which was then generalized to ‘hit, strike, beat’. Note: regarding the irregular reading for sumo in the example words, the two graphs mean ‘mutual striking’. KJ1970:773; MS1995:v1:560-61; OT1968:430. As with 1985, we suggest taking as a variant of (= odd) 業 278 ‘profession’.	STRIKING WITH THE HAND IS AN ODD PROFESSION – EXCEPT SUMO	images/Chapter7_img_1297.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_1295.jpg

Interpretations diverge. The seal form points to the original way of writing this graph as corresponding to 𠬸 . The top element in 𠬸 is an old form of 回 92 ‘go round’, with 又 2003 ‘hand’ beneath. This is interpreted in one view as ‘put hand into water and take something out’ (Gu, Ogawa [Ogawa takes to be water swirling round]); alternatively, taken as ‘try to pull out person drowning’ (Shirakawa). is a later (block script) variant of 𠬸 , and quite close in shape to 殳 as in the modern form 没 (see Note below). At the seal stage, 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’ was then added as a determinative, resulting in 沒 . Several commentators prefer to analyse 沒 differently, taking it as consisting of 氵 ‘water’ combined with as phonetic with associated sense ‘sink, disappear’, giving ‘sink down into whirlpool’ (Katō, Mizukami). The connotation ‘go round, whirlpool’ is supported by the seal form. If the interpretation ‘sink down into whirlpool’ is followed, ‘sink, die, not exist’ may be regarded as extended senses. Note: The right-hand element in the modern form is 殳 , normally a determinative meaning ‘strike (with weapon)’ (170), but in 没 this is instead a later, potentially confusing regularization in shape of with meaning as explained above.

Has 羽 82 ‘wings, plumage’, with 番 215 (‘turn, number; guard’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘flap in a flat manner’, giving ‘bird flaps wings and flies’ (Shirakawa), or ii] ‘return’, here referring to a bird returning its wings repeatedly to the same point, similarly giving ‘move wings up and down and fly’ (Ogawa).

Has 手 34 ‘hand’, with / 麻 1995 (‘nettle-like flax-producing plant, flax’) taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘make small’ (as abbreviation of NJK 靡 ‘divide up, make small’; see Note below), giving ‘rub with the hands and make small’ (Ogawa). Another view takes / 麻 ‘flax’ as both semantic and phonetic in function here, giving ‘open up flax-like plant material and put between the hands’ (to extract fibers) (Katō). The meaning of 摩 was later generalized to ‘rub, graze, scrape’. See 磨 1997 also. Note: 靡 consists of 麻 (originally written [see 麻 1995]) with 非 794 (‘not’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘open up’, to give ‘split open flax-like plant material and take out small fibers’; by extension, ‘small; scatter’, and also loan use for grammatical function word.

Seal form has 石 47 ‘stone’, with 靡 (NJK, ‘split open; small; scatter’ [see 1996 Note]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rub, grind’, giving ‘mill grindstone’. By extension, ‘grind, polish’. Although originally denoting use of a grindstone, this graph and 摩 1996 show a degree of interchangeability in meaning and use. Already in clerical script, the top element was commonly regularized in shape to 麻 1995 (‘hemp, flax’). DJ2009:v2:761; OT1968:715; SS1984:809; AS2007:389.

Consists of 月 209 ‘flesh, meat; body’, with 莫 (original way of writing 暮 982 ‘sunset’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘envelop’ (Shirakawa says ‘curtain, covering’), giving ‘that bodily component which envelops’, referring in this case not to skin itself but ‘membrane’. KJ1970:775; OT1968:826; SS1984:810. We suggest two mnemonics, one taking 莫 as ‘sunset’ (this time with only one sun, as originally) and the other by its elements. In the latter case, we suggest taking 大 as ‘big’ 56, 日 as ‘sun’ 66, and ‘grass’ 艹 53.	BIG FLESHY MEMBRANE COVERS SUNNY GRASS	images/Chapter7_img_1318.jpg

Has 木 73 ‘wood, tree’, with 冘 (CO, originally picto-graph of person carrying heavy object; see 1729 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sink into/onto’, giving ‘wooden artefact to sink head down onto’, i.e. ‘headrest, pillow’. While in the modern world we think of a pillow as something soft, in ancient China (and prewar Japan) hard materials such as wood and bamboo (and later porcelain) appear to have been the norm. TA1965:789-93; SS1984:609-10; MS1995:v1:112-13. As with 1729, we suggest taking 冘 as (heavy) man with crooked leg and broken arms.

Note: 曼 has 又 2003 ‘hand’, with 冒 1974 (‘headgear’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘grow, extend’. KJ1970:869; OT1968:386; MS1995:v1:632.

For analysis of 鬽 , see Note below. 魅 has 鬼 1179 ‘supernatural being, demon’, with 未 617 (‘immature’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘not visible’, thus ‘spectral being, ghost’; by extension, ‘enchant, bewitch’. Note: 鬽 has 鬼 1179 ‘demon’, here likely in its original sense of ‘spirit of dead person, supernatural being’, with 彡 115 ‘decorative feathers/colors, embellishment’, here taken as ‘long hair’, to give ‘longhaired supernatural being’. The ancient Chinese historical work Zuo Zhuan chooses to define more specifically as a four-legged beast with human face. KJ1970:868; DJ2009:v2:738-9; OT1968:1140.

Entry heading in Shuowen has a more ornate form, comprising 60 ‘insect(s)’, with 鼏 (CO, ‘cauldron lid, wine container lid’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘saliva’, giving ‘insect saliva’, and hence ‘honey’(Katō) (which is produced by bees through a regurgitation process). Another treatment takes the associated sense as ‘delicious smell’, giving ‘insects’ delicious-smelling (food)’, i.e. ‘honey’ (Ogawa). The graph was later abbreviated to 蜜 by using 虫 ‘insect’ for , and changing the phonetic to 宓 (CO, ‘quiet house’) (same associated sense as above).

Note: Mizukami also lists ‘(type of) plane’ as possible meaning for 戊 , which was originally a pictograph, though the OBI and bronze forms do suggest a weapon rather than a tool.

Has 目 76 ‘eye’, with 亡 985 (‘lose, die, disappear, not have’), taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘blind’ (Ogawa). Alternatively, 亡 is regarded as phonetic in function with associated sense ‘hidden’, giving ‘hidden and not visible’, with ‘blind’ as an extended sense (Tōdō). OT1968:696; TA1965:445-7.

The seal form has 禾 87 ‘grain’ (generic), with 毛 230 (‘hair, fur’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘empty’, giving original meaning ‘grain missing, no grain’, and by extension ‘empty; run out, use up’ (Katō). Shuowen defines 秏 as ‘type of rice’, which is how the graph and underlying word may have been used around the time of compilation of Shuowen , but 禾 is originally a pictograph of a grain plant with the head leaning down, and is generally understood as ‘grain’ as a general term encompassing millet, wheat, and rice, not just rice alone; as above, Katō takes in the general sense. Another commentator treats 毛 here as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘small’, and considers it to denote ‘small grains of rice’ (sic; Ogawa). As for the change in shape to 耗 , with the determinative changed from 禾 ‘grain’ to 耒 ’plow’ (CO, 699), this appears to have been a change made at some point in block script. Kangxi zidian has entries for both 秏 and 耗 ; in the entry for the former, it is noted that ‘texts nowadays all use 耗 ’.

Has 犭/犬 19 ‘dog’, with 孟 (‘first child; beginning’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘vigorous, strong, violent’, giving ‘fierce/violent dog’. Meanings such as ‘brave’ are extended senses. Note: analyses of 孟 (NJK, ‘beginning’) differ. In one view, 孟 comprises 子 27 ‘child’, with 皿 300 ‘bowl, cover’ taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘first’, giving ‘first child’ (Mizukami). Alternatively, 皿 is taken as semantic meaning ‘cover’, giving ‘child emerges (from beneath cover)/grows’ (Tōdō). Another view takes 皿 semantically as a bowl for bathing, giving ‘newborn baby’s first bath’, and hence ‘first’. Schuessler says ‘eldest (of siblings); first’.

冶	YA	smelt, melt	L1	2028	7	冶金 [YAKIN] - metallurgy; 陶冶 [TŌYA] - training; 鍛冶屋 [kajiya*] - blacksmith	Bronze ; seal . Seal form consists of 冫 401 ‘ice’, with 台 (‘I, me’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one approach either as i] ‘grow slack, relax’, or ii] ‘modify’. Either way, the resultant meaning is ‘smelt metal’ (in the case of i], by extension, and in ii] by indirect extension on the basis ‘modify metal in the same way as melting ice’). Another interpretation, though, takes the right-hand element in one of the bronze occurrences as a shape representing not ‘ice’ but ‘fire’. This commentator (Gu) still recognises 冫 ‘ice’ as the determinative in the seal form, explaining this as being by analogy (melting of ice and smelting metal both resulting in liquid states). Note: On the basis of sound values and older forms (bronze and seal) the phonetic element 台 in 冶 is to be taken not as 台 183 ‘stand, platform’ (traditional form: 臺 ), but a different graph of the same shape meaning ‘(say) I, me’. The latter consists of 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, with 厶 (interpretations vary, but include ‘make one’s own’, or ‘plow’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘I, me’. MS1995:v1:116-8,204-5,188-90; OT1968:103; GY2008:487. For mnemonic purposes only, we suggest taking here 台 as ‘platform’, or alternatively ム as nose and 口 as mouth 22.

The seal form consists of 弓 107 ‘bow’, with a variant of 璽 1419 “Imperial seal’ (q.v.) minus the dot low down, as phonetic with associated sense ‘slacken, loosen’; this gives ‘unstring a bow’; meaning then extended to ‘slacken, loosen’. Senses such as ‘increasingly’ are the result of a loan use. The right-hand element of 弥 perhaps reflects adaptation to block script of a cursified version of this graph, with the number of strokes reduced through writing cursively.

Has 足 54 ‘leg/foot’, and 翟 236, CO meaning ‘pheasant’ but also in word-family meaning ‘rise up, leap up’. Latter meaning was clarified by adding 足 , thus 躍 . Typically, 翟 here is taken as phonetic with the above associated sense, but Gu takes as both semantic and phonetic in function.

Has 門 231 ‘gate, door’, with 音 6 (‘sound’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘cover’, giving ‘close gate’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘put inside and close’, giving ‘put inside gates/entrance and close, making it dark’ (Tōdō). Tōdō takes ‘dark’ as an extended sense, while a noted pre-modern commentator on Shuowen (Duan Yucai, 1735-1815) regards as a loan use. OT1968:1062; TA1965:815-24; DJ2009:v3:967.

喩	YU, tato	compare, liken	L1	2033	12	比喩 [HIYU] - metaphor, simile; 比喩的 [HIYUTEKI] - figurative; 換喩 [KAN’YU] - metonymy	Seal a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 口 22 ‘mouth; speak’, with 兪 (CO, ‘hollow out log as boat’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘transfer, change’, giving original meaning ‘instruct’. ‘Speak figuratively, compare’ may perhaps be an extended sense. Note: the bronze form of 兪 is interpreted in one view as 舟 1450 ‘boat’, with a second element which is interpreted as ‘snake/cicada with cast-off skin’, giving ‘hollow out inner part of log and leave outer part as boat’ (Katō). Mizukami notes an alternative view which takes the second element as ‘blade for scraping/gouging out’, but giving the same overall meaning. Shirakawa, alternatively again, takes 舟 as ‘bowl’ (presumably a meaning extended from ‘hollow out log as boat’ [based on a classical Chinese source, but Tōdō does not agree]) and the main part of the second element as a large surgical needle for removing blood and pus, with the accompanying single stroke as ‘showing blood and pus being transferred into the bowl’. The graph ( 兪 ) exhibits some variation in shape in bronze. OT1968:191; KJ1970:500-01; MS1995:v1:100-01; SS1984:829; AS2007:623; TA1965:173-4. Difficult mnemonically, but we suggest taking 月 209 as ‘meat, body’, with arrows/pointers 巜 pointing to it, 亼 as a cover, and using 口 not as ‘speak’ but rather as ‘hole’.

Has 言 118 ‘words, speak’, with 兪 (CO; see 2033 Note) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘clarify’, giving ‘make clear with words’ (Katō), or ii] ‘remove’, giving ‘remove that which is not understood’, giving ‘instruct, give guidance’ (Ogawa). KJ1970:881; OT1968:939. As with 2034, we suggest taking 月 as ‘meat’ 209, 刂 as ‘cut’ 198, and 亼 as a cover.	VERBALLY ADMONISH AND INSTRUCT HOW TO COVER CUT MEAT	images/Chapter7_img_1358.jpg

Has 疒 404 ‘sick(bed)’, with 兪 (see 2033 Note) (later 愈 ) as phonetic with associated sense ‘emerge, quietly leave’, giving ‘emerge from illness’, i.e. ‘heal’. In the graph 癒 , 愈 as phonetic may be taken as a variant of 兪 . Note: Shirakawa sees 愈 and 愉 (traditional form of 愉 2034 has 兪 ) as variants of same graph, difference in form of ‘heart/feelings’ determinative ( 心 / 忄 , 164) not significant. Mizukami, though, sees 愈 and 愉 as two different graphs, but does not elaborate. OT1968:682; SS1984:830-31; GY2008:1624; MS1995:v1:518-9. Take 月 as ‘meat’ 209, 刂 as ‘cut’ 198, and 亼 as a cover.

Consists of 心 164 ‘feelings, heart, mind’, with 攸 (CO, ‘remove dirt/defilement’; see Note below’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘shake, jolt’, giving ‘one’s heart shakes, lament’ (Ogawa). This associated sense is noted by Mizukami along with another, viz. ‘continue in tenuous way’, giving ‘feelings continue in delicate and unhurried manner’. Note: 攸 is comprised of 攴 ( 攵 ) 112 ‘hit, strike’, with left-hand element interpreted as either ‘remove dirt’, giving overall meaning ‘remove dirt’, or ‘water drips down’ (some bronze occurrences of 攸 have three short vertical strokes instead of one [ 丨 ] to the right of 亻 41 (‘person’), lending support to interpretation as ‘water’), giving ‘cleanse body by letting water drip onto it’. Both interpretations are noted in Mizukami. OT1968:373; MS1995:v1:512-3,568-9; KJ1970:25-6. We suggest taking the upper part as 亻 41 ‘person’, 丨 as long stick, and strike 攵 .

Consists of 隹 324 ‘bird’, combined with 厷 (CO, ‘arm, elbow’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘bold’, ‘courageous’, giving ‘bold bird, male bird’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘light, vivid colors’, giving ‘bird of beautiful colors, male bird’ (Katō), or iii] ‘make outer frame taut’, giving ‘male bird puffs up its frame’ (Tōdō). Note: Seal form of 厷 has a shape similar to ム , here a picto-graphic representation of an arm bent at the elbow, combined with 又 2003 ‘right hand’ (sometimes just ‘hand’). OT1968:1077,817; KJ1970:265,397; MS1995:v1:190-91. We suggest taking 厷 literally, as ‘arm and elbow’.	POWERFUL MALE BIRD HAS ARMS AND ELBOWS!?	images/Chapter7_img_1371.jpg

One scholar (Shirakawa) questions whether Shuowen is correct in equating 誘 with . 誘 has 言 118 ‘words; speak’, with 秀 1451 (‘excel’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘put forward, promote’, giving ‘encourage, entice’.

憂	YŪ, ur	grief, sorrow	L1	2045	15	憂愁 [YŪSHŪ] - grief, gloom; 憂え顔 [ureegao] - sad look; 物憂い [monoui] - weary, gloomy	Seal ( 𢝊 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). 𢝊 (the original form of 憂 in Shuowen ) has 心 164 ‘heart, mind, feelings’, with 頁 103 (‘head’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘shrink, flinch’, thus giving ‘one’s heart shrinks/flinches’, or ii] ‘thin, flimsy’, giving ‘one’s heart grows weak with worries’, or iii] ‘faint, dim, easily sinks’, giving ‘one’s heart easily sinks through fear’ (the above interpretations all listed in Mizukami). In one view, the fuller form 憂 is taken as 夂 ‘foot, footprint’, combined with 𢝊 as phonetic with associated sense ‘do as one pleases’, thus giving original meaning ‘stroll around as one pleases’ (Mizukami); ‘lament, grieve’ is loan usage in this view. Another analysis takes as 頁 ‘head’ combined with 心 ‘heart, mind, feelings’ and 夂 ‘drag the foot’ (sic, but this is the meaning of similarly-shaped 夊 ), giving ‘legs unsteady through worry’ (also noted in Mizukami). For the troublesome elements 夂 and 夊 , see Appendix. DJ2009:v3:866; MS1995:v1:518-19,524-5; KJ1970:36. We suggest taking the lower part 夂 as crossed legs, upper part as variant or ‘strange’ head , and ‘heart’ 心 in the middle.

Consists of NJK 鬲 1431 ‘three-legged cauldron (with hollow legs)’ with 虫 60 (‘insect’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise up’, giving ‘steam rises/escapes’. It is not clear whether ‘melt, dissolve’ is an extended sense or loan use of 融 . Note: 虫 here may also have an onomatopoeic connotation for the sound of steam escaping (Mizukami, Katō), but the early Chinese values for 虫 are not really supportive of this. DJ2009:v1:240; MS1995:v2:1148-9; KJ1970:881; AS2007:189,443; TA1965:185-9. We suggest taking 鬲 as ‘one’ 一 1 round pot 口 , and stand .

Consists of 言 118 ‘words; speak’, with 與 2047 (traditional form of 与 ‘give, take part’) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘lift up’, giving ‘praise’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), or ii] ‘call out loudly’, giving ‘proclaim someone’s fame’ (Katō). The abbreviated shape 誉 appears to be based on cursivized occurrences (calligraphic models of Tang Dynasty onwards) of 譽 . TA1965:428-9; OT1968:929; KJ1970:136; FC1974:v2:2087-8. We suggest taking the upper part as ‘laden table’.	FAME BRINGS WORDS OF PRAISE AND LADEN TABLE	images/613a.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_1381.jpg
妖	YO, aya	enchanting, ominous	L1	2049	7	妖婦 [YŌFU] - enchantress; 妖術 [YŌJUTSU] - witchcraft; 妖雲 [YŌUN] - ominous cloud	Seal ( 𡝩 ) ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Shuowen has 女 37 ‘woman’, with 芺 (CO, a bitter-tasting type of plant) as phonetic; the graph is defined in that work as ‘skilful, or “woman smiling/laughing” ’. Later form 妖 has 女 combined with 夭 ‘young, beautiful’ (see Note below) taken in one view as semantic and phonetic, giving ‘seductive, enticing (female)’ (Ogawa). Later, also used in negative senses such as ‘ominous, unlucky’, possibly as a result of interchange or contamination between 妖 and 夭 (see Note below). Note: 夭 is interpreted in one analysis as representing a figure with tilted head acting flirtatiously (Mizukami; Katō is in broad agreement). Ogawa also takes it to show a tilted head, but as an infant with supple body, giving ‘young’. 夭 was used in early Chinese texts not just for the words with the positive meanings just noted, but also for words which were near-homophone(s) with negative meanings. 女 was added later to minimize ambiguity in writing between the two. The semantic progression for the group of words with negative associations is considered to be as follows: ‘bend’ &gt; ‘break, cut off’ &gt; ’kill prematurely’(later, 殀 ) (Schuessler). DJ2009:v3:1022; ZY2009:v3:1066; OT1968: 254,244; AS2007:559-60; MS1995:v1:296-8; KJ1970:84-5. Take 夭 as ‘big man’ 大 56 with big head .

揚	YŌ, a	raise, fry	L1	2051	12	揚水 [YŌSUI] - pumping water; 揚げ場 [ageba] - landing place; 揚げ物 [agemono] - fried food	Bronze ; seal . Originally (OBI, bronze) consists of 丮 (CO; depiction of a kneeling figure doing something with the hands: see also 1424), combined with 昜 161 (originally ‘sun rises’, modern meanings ‘change, easy’, see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise/lift up’, giving ‘lift up with the hands’. At the seal stage, 丮 was changed to 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’ Note: the original top element in bronze stage equivalents of 昜 is taken in one view to be 日 66 ‘sun’; Katō considers the lower elements to be 丂 130 (‘floating aquatic plant’, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense ‘rise’, together with 彡 115 ‘feathers, colored feathers’, the latter representing colored (reflected) rays of the sun. According to Katō, the overall meaning then becomes ‘colors/brilliance of the risen morning sun’; ‘rise up’ is an extended sense. Another analysis takes the top part of 昜 as ‘jade disc/precious stone on a stand’, with rays of reflected light (Shirakawa), leading to ‘raise up (as an offering)’. The meaning ‘fry’ is probably loan usage, though it may possibly relate to raising some food item from a vat, which would suggest an extended meaning.

Consists of 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’, with (CO, ‘bake pottery/earthenware’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘move without stopping’ (Katō), or ii] ‘shake’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘supple, pliant’ (Ogawa), giving overall meaning ‘shake, sway’. Note: consists of 缶 , originally meaning ‘earthenware vessel’ 缶 1141 (here in 2052 taken as representative of pottery/earthenware), with 月 ( 肉 ) 209 ‘meat, flesh’ as phonetic with associated sense ‘bake [tiles etc.]’ (Katō; Gu is in broad agreement). The modern form has a simplification to the upper right element. KJ1970:83-4; TA1965:195-6; OT1968:424; GY2008:1089-90. We suggest taking 爫 1739 ‘reaching hand, claw’, and 缶 1141 as ‘can’.

Consists of 氵 water’ 42, with 容 822 (‘contain; appearance’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘vigorous/extensive’, giving ‘pour water into container up to the brim’ (Katō), or ii] ‘well up’, giving ‘current/force of water is strong’ (Ogawa). The senses ‘melt’ and ‘dissolve’ appear to represent loan usage resulting from earlier interchangeability between 溶 with 熔 ‘melt’ and 鎔 ‘smelt/melt’ (both NJK) (Ogawa, Katō). OT1968:602; KJ1970:888. We suggest taking 容 as 宀 30 ‘roof, house’ and 谷 135 ‘valley’.	HOUSE DISSOLVES IN VALLEY FULL OF WATER	images/Chapter7_img_1390.jpg

Consists of 疒 404 ‘sick(bed)’, with 昜 161 (‘colors of risen morning sun’, etc.; see 2051 Note) as phonetic. The commentators below do not specify the associated sense, but it may be taken as ‘rise, emerge’, giving ‘boil, ulcer, tumor’. OT1968:681; SS1984:852.

踊	YŌ, odo	dance, leap	L2	2056	14	舞踊 [BUYŌ] - dance, dancing; 踊り子 [odoriko] - dancing girl; 盆踊り [BON odori] - Bon Dance	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Has 足 54 ‘foot, leg’, combined with 甬 (CO, ‘suspension ring at top of bell’; see 2040 Note) as phonetic with associated sense ‘hit, strike’, giving original meaning ‘stamp feet on the ground’. Shirakawa suggests this may have been part of a funerary ritual, but does not elaborate. ‘Dance’ may be regarded as an extended sense if one follows this view. In similar vein, Katō also regards the meaning of the graph as ‘feet leaving the ground’, hence ‘dance’. OT1968:973; SS1984:852; KJ1985:589-90. We suggest taking the elements as 足 ‘leg’, 用 as ‘use’ 235, and マ as ‘bent knee’ (or ‘bent elbow’ for those who ‘do the turkey’).

窯	YŌ, kama	kiln, oven	L1	2057	15	窯業 [YŌGYŌ] - ceramics; 窯業家 [YŌGYŌKA] - ceramist; 乾燥窯 [KANSŌgama] - drying kiln	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 穴 860 ‘hole, cave’, combined with 羔 (NJK, ‘newborn lamb’), taken in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘bake’, giving ‘cavity for baking earthenware’, i.e. ‘kiln, oven’ (Ogawa). The graph 羔 is made up of 羊 426 (‘sheep’, slightly abbreviated to ), combined with 灬 ( 火 ) 8, ‘fire’ making it a distinct possibility that ‘roast a lamb’ may have been the original meaning, then generalized to ‘roast, bake’, but most commentators do not favor this analysis, probably in part at least because Shuowen defines 羔 as ‘newborn lamb’. Amniotic fluid takes its name from the Greek term amnos (lamb), and features in some graphs relating to human birth (see 432), so it is tempting to interpret the four dots in the modern form as droplets of amniotic fluid. However, the seal form above shows clearly that it is definitely the fire determinative. Shirakawa supports ‘newborn lamb’ on the basis of certain seal forms, the shape of which might be interpreted as ‘lamb/sheep standing’. Note, though, that Ma and Gu give much older OBI forms that clearly have 火 as the bottom element. A later popular variant of 窯 is 窰 , with ‘bake pottery/earthenware’ (CO; see 2052 Note) as the lower element. OT1968:743; SS1984:852,302-3; MR2007:294; GY2008:1121. We suggest taking as ‘little sheep’ (i.e. lamb), along with ‘hole’ 穴 860 as ‘pit’, and ‘fire’ 灬 8.

The seal form has 扌 / 手 34 ‘hand’, with 雝 (CO, ‘bird protects its eggs’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘surround, enclose’, giving ‘enclose with the hands/arms, embrace’; by extension, ‘protect’. Kangxi zidian lists both 𢹬 and 擁 , but the 𢹬 entry refers the reader to 擁 as the main entry. 雝 as phonetic in was later abbreviated to 雍 . Note: 雝 is comprised of 隹 324 ‘bird’, with 邕 (CO; ‘external moat [around city, etc.]’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘enclose, block off’. Mizukami also notes an alternative interpretation, namely ‘enclose and protect birds’. Either way, the overall meaning is still ‘embrace, surround’. KJ1970:884; OT1968:431.1078; MS1995:v2:1412-3,1318-9; ZY2009:v2:442,436; AS2007:577. We suggest taking the graph’s elements as ‘hand’ 扌 , ‘bird’ 隹 , top 亠 , and 乡 as variant of ‘short thread’, 幺 29.

Seal form consists of 氵 / 水 42 ‘water’, with 芺 2049 (‘[type of ] bitter-tasting plant’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘sprinkle’, giving ‘sprinkle/moisten with water’. By extension, ‘fertile’. Transition from 芺 to 夭 (‘young, beautiful’ etc.; see 2049 Note) as phonetic (same associated sense) began to occur at the clerical script stage. OT1968:564; GY2008:498; SS1984:857; SK1984:441.

Shuowen has 飛 595 (‘fly’), with 異 826 (‘differ’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘pair of wings, pair’, thus ‘bird flies with pair (of wings)’. 翼 , with 羽 ( 羽 82 ‘wings’) as top element, is also noted. Clerical script occurrences also have the more familiar and less intricate 羽 / 羽 . Kangxi zidian lists both forms with 飛 and 羽 as top element, as separate entries (form with latter is main).

Seal form has 衤 444 ‘clothes’, with (CO; ‘snail’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘expose’ (Ogawa, Shirakawa), thus ‘expose skin without garment’, i.e. ‘naked’. Shuowen has CO as entry heading, but goes on to note 裸 as an alternative form. Note: scholars differ regarding historical fluctuation in the form of the phonetic element in this graph and its interpretation. We have taken the broader view.

Usually taken as 貝 10 ‘shell (/currency)’, with 剌 (NJK ‘oppose; painful’; see Note 1 below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘profit’, giving ‘profit’. Note 1: 剌 has 刂 198 ‘knife’, with 束 561 (‘bundle’) taken as i] phonetic with associated sense ‘bent’, thus ‘knife is bent’ and by extension ‘go against’, or ii] semantically as ‘bundle’ (of firewood etc), giving ‘branch being cut for firewood springs up/back’; both analyses are listed in Mizukami. Note 2: An alternative view of 賴 (noted by Mizukami) takes seal form right side not as 刀 ‘knife’ but as 勹 41 ‘person’ (both similar in shape at the seal stage) over 貝 , and left side as 朿 (CO, ‘thorn’ as abbrev of 刺 1403 ‘stab’) with associated sense as ‘indiscriminate’, thus ‘put responsibility onto others when borrowing and lending money’. ‘Request, rely’ are extended meanings.

Has 酉 318 ‘wine jar’ (here indicating fermentation), with 各 462 (‘each, every’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one analysis as ‘sour’ (Ogawa). Shuowen xinfu ( Shuowen, Newly Appended ) defines 酪 as ‘milk made into a thick paste’; Shirakawa takes this as signifying milk products made into a drink or into cheese, and Gu is in broad agreement.

藍	RAN, ai	indigo	L1	2072	18	出藍 [SHUTSURAN] - besting master; 藍色 [aiiro] - indigo color; 伽藍 [GARAN] - Buddhist temple	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 艹 53 ‘plant, vegetation’, combined with 監 1159 (‘supervise, watch’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Shuowen defines 藍 as a ‘plant to dye things blue’. It refers to the plant itself, and by extension its use as a dye for the color indigo (dark violet-blue). The first recorded use of indigo in Japan was in a Nara temple around 620, and for a century or so it was used only by the privileged classes. However, from around the 9th century it became widely available through the advent of vat dyeing. It is especially favored for its resistance to fading and water. In modern times indigo dye has been produced synthetically. OT1968:876; SS1984:866; GY2008:1547.	PRODUCTION OF INDIGO PLANTS AND DYES NEEDS SUPERVISON	images/Chapter7_img_1416.jpg

Has 木 73 ‘tree, wood’, with 闌 (NJK, ‘partition’), taken in one view semantically to give ‘wood for partition’, and by extension ‘railing’; by further extension, ‘boundary’ (Ogawa). Another view takes 闌 slightly differently as phonetic with associated sense ‘enclose on four sides’, with overall meaning ‘pen (for animals)’ (supported by Shirakawa as a minor meaning), and more broadly as ‘frame which surrounds’ (Katō). Regarding ‘margin, column’ in a written text, Shirakawa notes the term 烏糸欄 ushiran referred to main text on a page enclosed in the traditional way with four lines in a box shape, and the space outside the box, i.e. the margin space, was termed 欄外 rangai .

履	RI, ha	footwear, walk, act	L1	2076	15	履歴 [RIREKI] - curriculum vitae; 履行 [RIKŌ] - performance; 履物 [hakimono] - footwear	Seal ( 𢔃 ) . Analyses diverge. Leaving aside initially the top element 尸 (256 ‘corpse’, ‘person lying down’: see below), there is general agreement regarding the element 舟 1450 (‘boat’), namely that here it represents boat-shaped footwear. This combines with 彳 131 ‘road; go’, and an element for ‘foot’ here typically identified by scholars as 夊 , which is often interpreted as ‘drag the foot’ (see Appendix). These three elements contribute to an overall meaning ‘walk (slowly) dragging the feet wearing shoes/clogs’ (‘wooden shoes’, i.e. ‘clogs’ is favored by Katō). The top element 尸 (‘corpse’, also meanings including ‘substitute person for deceased’ [in a ritual context]) is treated in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘drag’ (Katō, Mizukami). Alternatively, 尸 here is taken not as phonetic but semantic as ‘substitute person for the deceased ’, and the whole graph is considered in this view originally to have referred to the wearing of shoes (made not of wood but of fabric) when conducting a ritual (Shirakawa). The two similarly-shaped ‘foot’ elements 夂 and 夊 appear to have given rise to a degree of confusion and fluctuation over the centuries, and 履 is a case in point: clerical script occurrences predominantly have the ‘foot’ element changed from 夊 to 夂 (assuming one accepts that the element here was originally 夊 ), and in terms of overall shape the graph was moving towards its modern form at that stage. Mizukami lists several proposed bronze equivalents. ‘Act’ is probably an extended sense. MS1995:v1:412-4; DJ2009:v2:692; KJ1970:296-7; SS1984:872; SK1984:244.

璃	RI	lapis lazuli	L1	2077	15	瑠璃 [RURI] - lapis lazuli; 浄瑠璃 [JŌRURI] - jōruri ballad drama; は璃 [HARI] - glass, crystal	A late, post- Shuowen graph. Has 玉 15 ‘jewel’ (in abbreviated shape ), with 离 (CO; ‘mountain deity [in beast form]’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Overall meaning according to 6th century Yupian dictionary is ‘lapis lazuli’, a deep blue semi-precious stone. Originally, 璃 seems to have referred to ore of lapis lazuli, then by extension to it when refined, then to natural crystal, then to early form of glass. GY2008:1678; OT1968:727. Awkward. We suggest 亠 as lid, 凶 as box with contents, and ‘strange insect’ ( 虫 60).	LIDDED BOX OF LAPIS LAZULI – BUT FULL OF STRANGE INSECTS!	images/623a.jpg; images/Chapter7_img_1421.jpg
離	RI, hana	separate, leave	L1	2078		分離 [BUNRI] - separation; 離陸 [RIRIKU] - take-off; 乳離れ [chibanare] - weaning	Seal . Analyses diverge. In one analysis the graph is taken as 隹 324 ‘bird’, with 离 (CO, ‘mountain deity [in beast form]’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear), originally denoting a type of bird (‘black-naped oriole’ [ Oriolus chinensis ]); and in this view meanings such as ‘become separated’ are seen as loan usage (Ogawa). Another analysis takes 离 as an abbreviation for 黐 ‘birdlime’, giving overall meaning for 離 as ‘bird caught on birdlime’; and by extension, ‘remove from birdlime’, a meaning which was then generalized to ‘remove’ (with obvious connotations of separation and leaving) (Shirakawa). The above explanation relates to the seal form. Mizukami proposes OBI equivalents also, though his analysis relates to the seal form, and he regards ‘become separated’ as a loan use. OT1968:1081; SS1984:873; MS1995:v2:1414-15; AS2007:348. As with 2077, we suggest taking the elements of this awkward character as 亠 as a lid, 凶 as a box with contents, and ‘strange insect’ ( 虫 60).

隆	RYŪ	high, swell, rise, prosper	L1	2083	11	隆盛 [RYŪSEI] - prosperity; 隆起 [RYŪKI] - upthrust, bulge; 興隆 [KŌRYŪ] - prosperity, rise	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional 隆 . Interpretations differ. In one view, the graph consists of 阝(阜) 262 ‘hill, mound’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘swell up’, giving ‘hill swells/rises up’ (Ogawa). Another analysis takes as 生 44 ‘life, birth, grow’, with 降 873 (‘descend’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘luxuriant, big’, giving ‘grow luxuriantly’ (Gu). Senses such as ‘high; prosper’ are extended meanings. Quite a different interpretation is adopted by Shirakawa, who alone treats 阝 as having religious significance meaning ‘ladder for deities (to descend and ascend)’, combined with 夂 meaning ‘descend’ (see Appendix) and 土 64 ‘earth, ground’, signifying the welcoming of deities down to Earth. Qiu indicates that old (e.g. clerical script) forms of 隆 with 土 ‘earth’ in place of 生 do exist, which he takes as consisting of 土 combined with 降 as phonetic in function. Note that the modern form has dropped the short horizontal line on the right-side of the traditional form. OT1968:1071; GY2008:1345; SS1984:878; QX2000:254. We suggest taking 夂 as crossed legs.

Consists of 亻/人 41 ‘person’, combined with 呂 2119 (proposed meanings include ‘spine’) as phonetic with associated sense taken as ‘gather, be side by side’, giving ‘companion, friend’. GY2008:654,260-61; OT1968:68; SS1984:880. We suggest taking the right side as two mouths (speaking) 口 22 with a link between their comments. Or, mouth-to-mouth contact.

Has 力 78 ‘strength’, combined with 毌 1148 ‘pierce, penetrate’ (see Note below), with – in one view – 虍 1301 (‘tiger’, q.v.) as phonetic with associated sense ‘prison’, giving ‘put in prison; prisoner’ (Ogawa). Gu makes a broadly similar analysis, but takes 虍 as having a semantic as well as phonetic function (‘violent, savage’), and originally meaning ‘take by force’, with ‘capture’ as an extended sense. Note: OBI occurrences of 毌 ‘pierce, penetrate’ are taken in one interpretation as representing a shield, or alternatively as shells (shell currency) pierced and strung together on a length of string (both given in Mizukami). It might be tempting to take the line through the shield as indicating ‘pierce a shield’, but in all cases the line is horizontal or vertical in relation to the shield, suggesting orderly construction rather than invasive piercing (in the latter case, one would tend to expect a diagonal piercing line). N.B. 毌 should be distinguished from another graph very similar in shape, viz. 毋 , originally standing for a word meaning ‘do not violate woman’, then borrowed for ‘there is none, do not…’. 毌 1148 was more distinct in shape in OBI and bronze, while 毋 ‘do not violate woman’ only became distinct in shape from 母 222 ‘mother’ from seal onwards. MS1995:v1:718-20; OT1968:882; GY2008:611,127. For the modern form, we suggest taking the lower part as 男 57 male/man.	MAN CAPTURES TIGER	images/626a.jpg

In one view, it consists of 心 164 ‘heart, mind’, with 𧆨 (Gu equates with CO 瓮 ‘urn, earthen jar’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘set out in words, relate’, giving ‘ponder extensively’ (Ogawa). Another analysis takes the graph as 思 147 ‘think’, with 虍 1301 (‘tiger’, q.v. 1301) as phonetic with associated sense ‘count, calculate’, giving ‘consider and count’ as original meaning (Katō).

了	RYŌ	understand, finish, complete	L2	2088	2	了解 [RYŌKAI] - understood!; 了承 [RYŌSHŌ] - understanding; 終了 [SHŪRYŌ] - finish	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ). Shuowen takes it to be a pictograph of a child with arms withered and twisted, positioned close to the body (torso); this view is followed by Katō. Similarly, Gu sees it as representing an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes, in effect bringing the limbs close to the body. Another scholar sees it as string or cord that has been tied (Ogawa). A more general – and perhaps safer – view of the seal form is that it depicts ‘something twisted’ (Shirakawa). Its modern meanings would seem to be loan usages. KJ1970:920-21; GY2008:17; OT1968:29; SS1984:882. Take as armless infant ( 子 27).	ONE UNDERSTANDS THAT A CHILD NEEDS ARMS TO BE COMPLETE	images/Chapter7_img_1432.jpg

Has 犭 19 ‘dog’, with 巤 (CO, for meanings see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘collect, gather’, giving ‘collect prey together’ (Tōdō, Ogawa), or ii] ‘leap high over’, giving ‘dogs leap high chasing prey’ (Katō). 猟 is based on cursive equivalents. Note: 巤 is taken as meaning ‘mask for frightening demons away’, or ‘animal mane’; both are listed by Mizukami. TA1965:842-5; MS1995:v1:426-7; OT1968:645; KJ1970:924; FC1974:v2:1438.

僚	RYŌ	colleague, official	L1	2092	14	同僚 [DŌRYŌ] - colleague; 僚友 [RYŌYŪ] - friend, colleague; 官僚 [KANRYŌ] - official	Seal . Consists of 亻 / 人 41 ‘person’, with 尞 (CO ‘burn’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘work’, giving ‘person who works alongside’ (Katō), or ii] ‘place where officials live’, giving ‘colleagues who are officials’ (Ogawa), or iii] ‘be linked, continue’, giving ‘person who works alongside in same office’ (noted in Mizukami). Mizukami). Sense modified (depending on interpretation of original meaning) to ‘official’, along with ‘colleague’. Mizukami lists proposed OBI equivalents. Note: the OBI forms of 尞 depict a pile of wood (firewood) being burned, giving ‘pile up wood and burn’; the sense was then generalized to ‘burn’. On a cultural note, in ancient China aspirants to a position in officialdom, which was considered an elite occupation, had to sit written examinations largely based on the Confucian classics. That is, they earned their position through hard work and study and merit. By contrast, in early Japan, despite a strong influence from China in a variety of ways, including various political institutions and legal frameworks, examinations for officials were replaced by recommendations, and bureaucrats were largely aristocrats. KJ1995:918-9; OT1968:81; SS1984:885; MS1995:v1:82-3,402-03. Awkward mnemonically, but we suggest taking the elements on the right-side as ‘big’ 大 56, 丷 as ‘away’ 八 70, ‘day/sun’ 日 66, and 小 ‘little’ 38.

Has 疒 404 ‘sick(-bed)’, with 樂 98 (‘music; pleasure’; later, 尞 [see 2092 Note]) as phonetic with associated sense taken either as i] ‘assess and put right’ (Ogawa), or ii] ‘good’ or ‘control’, giving ‘treat illness’ (Katō). According to Shirakawa, the earlier form 𤻲 reflects an ancient Chinese method of treating illness, whereby bells were struck near the patient in order to drive out the demons of sickness; later, after that practice ceased, the phonetic was changed to 尞 . DJ2009:v2:613; OT1968:682; SS1984:888; KJ1970:919. Take 尞 as ‘big’ 大 56, 丷 as ‘away’ 八 70, ‘day/sun’ 日 66, and 小 ‘little’ 38.

Alternatively, 量 is taken as a sack of fixed size for measuring grain, giving ‘provisions of fixed amount’ (Shirakawa). Either view leads to ‘provisions’ and – as a generalized sense – ‘materials’ and ‘measure’. OT1968:765; TA1965:360-62; SS1984:888.

倫	RIN	principles, ethics	L1	2098	10	倫理 [RINRI] - principles, ethics; 人倫 [JINRIN] - morality; 絶倫 [ZETSURIN] - peerless	Seal ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Consists of 人 41 ‘person’, with 侖 631 (CO, ‘align bound bamboo/wooden tablets’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘order’ sequence’, giving ‘orderly personal relations’, and hence ‘principles, ethics’. Note: 侖 consists of 亼 ‘collect, bring together’ (originally, pictograph of lid/cover over something [ Shuowen erroneously analyses as three things put together]), over 冊 884 ‘(slim) bound volume’, giving ‘(number of slim) volumes bound together in order’.

隣	RIN, tonari	neighbor, adjoin	L1	2099	16	隣室 [RINSHITSU] - next room; 隣接 [RINSETSU] - adjacency; 隣合う [tonariau] - adjoin	Seal ( 鄰 ) ; a late graph ( Shuowen ). Originally consists of 邑 / 阝 ‘village, settlement’ (normally right -hand 阝 376, not left -hand 262, which signifies ‘hill, mound’ etc.), combined with 粦 (CO; for meanings, see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘lined up, side by side’, giving ‘village/settlement with dwellings arranged side by side’. By extension, ‘neighboring’ and ‘adjoin’. It is not clear as to when exactly the element 阝 was relocated. Note: 粦 is taken in one view as the modified version of , consisting of 炎 1050 ‘flames’, combined with 舛 336 (‘feet pointed in opposite directions’) as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘stamp on and scatter’; overall meaning: ‘flames scattered through stamping’, or ‘flickering flames, will-o’-the-wisp’ (Mizukami). Alternatively, based on one of the bronze forms for 粦 , another commentator interprets the top element differently as 大 56 (‘big’) representing ‘person’, and takes the short dot-like strokes as drops of blood dripping down, with overall meaning ‘human sacrifice made before ladder for deities (to descend and ascend)’ (Shirakawa). The latter view is based in part on Shirakawa’s idiosyncratic interpretation of left-hand 阝 (abbreviated form of 阜 1907 when occurring as left-hand element), which is usually taken to mean ‘hill, mound, etc.’. MS1995:v2:1340-41,v1:808-09,796-7; OT1968:1075; TA1965:477-80; SS1984:890-92. Taking modern form, albeit with an error, we suggest 米 ‘rice’ 220, 舛 336 as opposed feet/stamp, and ‘mound’ 阝 .

Shuowen has 玉 15 ‘jewel, jade, precious stone’ in abbreviated shape, with 丣 (CO; ‘closed gate’) as phonetic, and defines as ‘lapis lazuli’. The phonetic element was later changed to 432 (‘flow’) or 留 824 (‘stop; fasten’) with associated sense ‘smooth’, giving ‘smooth precious stone’. Used in combination with 璃 2077, another graph of the same or very close meaning, to write 瑠 璃 ‘lapis lazuli’. DJ2009:v1:30; TA1965:204; SS1984:893.

Has 糸 29 ‘thread’, with 畾 (CO; orig. form of 靁 ‘thunder’ [ 雷 2066]) as phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate, follow one after another’, giving ‘join together’. ‘Involved’ is extended sense.

Has 力 78 ‘strength, effort’, with 萬 (traditional equivalent for 万 227 ‘ten thousand, myriad’; originally, pictograph of scorpion) as phonetic with associated sense ‘strive’ or similar (Tōdō says ‘apply great stimulus’), giving ‘great effort’. There is also the form 勵 , which seems to be a later variant, with 厲 (NJK,‘whetstone’) as phonetic in place of 萬 ; possibly this evolved as a folk etymology (i.e. erroneous etymology) based on interpreting the meaning of 勱 as deriving from sharpening one’s efforts. Zhengzitong (1771) treats 勵 as a popular variant. 勵 was, though, given official status in Japan in the first Jōyō kanji List of 1923; this was replaced by 励 in the Tōyō kanji list of 1946. MS1995:v2:1124-6; DJ2009:v3:1135; KJ1970:916-17; TA1965:551; KZ2001:268/3671; ZZ1671:v1:180. Take 厂 as cliff, and 力 as ‘strongly’.

戻	RUI, modo	return, reject, vomit	L2	2105	7	戻し税 [modoshiZEI] - tax refund; 返戻 [HENREI] - return; 戻しそう [modoshisō] - feeling sick	Seal ; late graph ( Shuowen ); traditional . The traditional interpretation ( Shuowen ) is that this graph, comprising 犬 19 ‘dog’ with 戸 120 ‘door’, represents a dog twisting and turning to get under a door or entrance, and this is followed by several scholars (Ogawa, Katō). Katō takes ‘go back’ as an extended sense deriving from a dog going back – i.e. return – to its original shape (posture) after getting under a door. However, this proposed Shuowen -based etymology seems questionable. An alternative proposal by Shirakawa takes as showing a dog buried beneath an entrance as a preventative spell. A further analysis treats it as 犬 , with 戸 as phonetic with associated sense ‘shut in’, giving ‘wild/rampaging dog is shut in (by entrance)’, and by extension ‘act contrary to, go against’ (noted in Mizukami). Etymology of this graph is debated; Schuessler has ‘arrive, reach, settle’ as possible meanings for 戻 in a word-family related to 来 237 ‘come’ (as opposed to ‘return’). OT1968:398; KJ1970:1917; SS1984:897; MS1995:v1:546-7; AS2007:342-3. ‘Dog’ has now been replaced by what is in effect ‘big’ 大 56.

Shuowen has as the main entry, and notes 靈 as an alternative form. Firstly, : this has 王 5 (‘ruler’), but here representing 玉 15 (‘jade, precious stone’; at the seal stage, the two were virtually identical in shape), combined with 霝 , taken here in one view as phonetic with associated sense ‘descend, come down’, giving ‘precious stone used by shaman/shamaness to bring deities down’ (noted in Mizukami). The alternative form 靈 has 巫 ‘shaman/shamaness’, with 霝 (‘rain, rain falls’; see 零 2107) as phonetic with associated sense ‘descend’, taken as giving ‘shaman/shamaness for whom fearsome deity descends’ (also listed in Mizukami, with nuance ‘fearsome deity, ghost’ in place of ‘deity’). Alternatively, Ogawa takes 霝 as semantic in function meaning ‘rain’, giving ‘shaman/shamaness prays for rain’. Both and 靈 occur at the clerical script stage; 霊 is based on cursive forms. On a cultural note, Japanese ghosts are traditionally supposed to have no legs. MS1995:v2:860-62; DJ2009:v1:30; OT1968:1087; SK1984:773; FC1974:v2:2418-20.

隷	REI	slave, prisoner	L1	2109	16	奴隷 [DOREI] - slave; 奴隷制 [DOREISEI] - slavery; 隷属 [REIZOKU] - subordination	Seal ( 隸 ) ; traditional 隸 . Consists of 隶 ‘catch up with’ 1668 (see Note below), with 柰 (original meaning [provisional]: ‘quince’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘join, bind, make into a pair’, giving ‘capture and make into slave/servant’ and hence ‘slave, prisoner’. Also used in Qin and Han dynasties as a term for low-ranking officials in charge of prisoners. The script used (though not actually devised) by them for administrative purposes, significantly abbreviated from the seal script, came to be known as 隷書 REISHO (Ch. lishu ), usually in English called ‘clerical script’ or ‘scribe script’. Clerical script represents an important stage in the historical development of the Chinese script. Clerical script occurrences of this graph have both 隸 and 隷 ; historically speaking, the latter is a variant form, but now the standard in Japanese usage. Note: several scholars give a pre-seal form, but its status is questionable, and so we take the seal form as the correct early form (as does Katō). MS1995:v2:1404-5; KJ1970:916; QX2000:103-112. Suggest taking 隶 as 肀 hand seizing, 氺 as (sweat) droplets, and left-hand as 士 ‘samurai’ 521 and 示 ‘show’ 723.	SAMURAI SHOWS HOW HE SEIZED SLAVE DESPITE SWEATY HAND	images/Chapter7_img_1457.jpg

Consists of 齒 ‘teeth’ (traditional form of 歯 306), combined with 令 633 (‘order, rule’) as phonetic with associated sense taken in one view as ‘count’, giving ‘count teeth and determine age’ (Katō); meaning later narrowed to ‘age’. Shirakawa notes that the age of cattle is easily ascertained by checking their teeth. Another scholar (Ogawa) analyses the graph differently, taking 齒 as ‘age, years’ (presumably as extended sense), with 令 as phonetic with associated sense ‘pass, elapse’, giving overall meaning ‘age’. Note that the modern form has the simplified version of the graph for ‘teeth’, i.e. 歯 , with inner shape the same as ‘rice’ 米 220. KJ1970:915; OT1968:1173; SS1984:900. We suggest taking the modern left-hand form(s) as ‘rice’ 米 220 in the ‘mouth’ 口 22, and 止 143 ‘stop’, and for the right-hand retaining 令 as ‘order’ 633.

In one view, analyzed as consisting of 日 66 ‘sun, day’, with 厤 (CO; ‘divide up evenly/carefully’ – see 歴 636 ‘history, path’, and for 秝 see Note below) taken as phonetic with associated sense ‘walk with regular intervals’, giving ‘sun moves with regular intervals’ (Katō). In similar vein, Ogawa takes 厤 as phonetic with associated sense ‘divide up equally’, to give ‘(device) for counting by arranging/setting out days’, i.e. ‘calendar’. According to Qiu, 曆 was devised to represent unambiguously in writing the word for‘calendar’, which had until then been represented using 歴 636 (path/movement followed by sun and other heavenly bodies at regular intervals). Shirakawa, by contrast, puts forward several proposed bronze forms for 曆 /暦 which feature not 日 ‘sun, day’ but 曰 1048 ‘speak’, which he interprets as ‘announce on banner military prowess at camp gates’. The form 暦 , now standard in Japanese usage, evolved as relatively late variant (block script stage). Note: 秝 (CO; reduplication of 禾 87 ‘grain plant’) is taken in one view as ‘arrange grain seedlings equidistantly’ or ‘arranged properly’ (Mizukami). Shirakawa, alternatively, takes 秝 to represent grain plants placed to mark the entrance to a military camp. KJ1970:921; OT1968:474; MS1995:v1:186-7,v2:966-7; QX2000:357; OT1968:474; SS1984:902-3.

Consists of 力 78 ‘strength’ combined with 少 160 ‘few, little’, giving in one view ‘strength diminished, less strength’ (Tōdō, Ogawa). Another commentator (Katō) considers ‘bend’ to be a connotation, giving ‘bend easily due to poor strength’, and by extension ‘weak’. Either way, ‘inferior’ is an extended sense.

Shuowen has only 孌 ; 戀 is later variant. 孌 has 女 37 ‘woman’, with (‘unravel tangled thread’; see Note 1) as phonetic with associated sense taken as i] ‘connected’ &gt; ‘connected to woman’ (Katō), or ii] ‘entangled’ &gt; ‘entangled with woman’ (Tōdō), or iii] ‘draw’ &gt; ‘drawn towards woman’ (Ogawa) (see Note 2). For 戀 , meanings are adjusted to i] ‘heart connected’, or ii] ‘heart entangled’, or iii] ‘heart drawn to’. Clerical script already has 戀 ; 恋 is based on cursive forms of 戀 . Note 1: one bronze form of shows hand over three skeins of silk thread, seen as ‘untangle thread’; some bronze/seal forms have 絲 ‘silk’ (two skeins of silk thread), with 言 (‘words’ 118) as phonetic with associated sense ‘tangled’ &gt; ‘(silk) thread gets tangled’, or ‘unravel tangled thread’ (given in Mizukami). Note 2: the associated senses given by Ogawa and Tōdō relate to the form of this graph with heart 心 164, but have been applied here also to earlier equivalent with 女 .

According to Katō, one of the manuscripts of Shuowen notes 爐 as popular equivalent of 鑪 . 鑪 has 金 16 ‘metal’, with 盧 (NJK, ‘container’; see Note below) taken either as semantic and phonetic meaning ‘box’, giving ‘hearth; brazier’ (Ogawa), or as phonetic with associated sense ‘be/put in’, giving ‘brazier’ (Katō). By extension, ‘furnace’. Note: 盧 is treated by Mizukami and Katō as identical to 𧆭 , meaning ‘container’; Gu takes 𧆭 as ‘earthen jar’. GY2008:1228; OT1968:617; KJ1970:899-900; MS1995:v2:910-11.

According to Katō, in ancient times gifts were brought to court and laid out as tribute, and the original meaning of this graph is ‘present/set out gifts’. Shirakawa agrees this was the original meaning. ‘Bribe’ evolved at an early juncture as an extended sense. KJ1970:193; SS1984:910.	USE EACH AND EVERY SHELL AS A BRIBE	images/Chapter7_img_1471.jpg

Has 雨 3 ‘rain’, with 路 439 (‘road’) as phonetic with associated sense ‘condense’, giving ‘weather element that condenses’ – in this case a reference to rain-like ‘dew’. Gu suggests ‘expose’ is an extended sense based on dew forming outside where there is no obstruction to stop it forming; perhaps best seen as tentative. ‘Small’ may be extended sense from droplet.

Graph has 阝 376 ‘village’ as right-hand element, with 良 628 (‘good’) as phonetic (associated sense unclear). Originally used to denote a village in the ancient Chinese state of Lu. The meaning ‘male’ derives from use of underlying word by women in ancient China to refer to husband, later becoming extended in meaning. In Japanese, typically occurs as a suffix in some male given names (e.g. 太郎 Tarō). KJ1970:539-40; TA1965:361. Take as ‘variant ‘good’ 良 .

Originally denoted a river name in ancient China (lower reaches of the Han River [a tributary of the Yangtze]). Katō treats its modern meanings as loan usage, but ‘wave’ and ‘drift’ may be felt to be extended senses. OT1968:583; KJ1970:894; TA1965:360-62.

Has 木 73 ‘wood,’, with 婁 (meanings include ‘shamaness’; see Note below) as phonetic with associated sense ‘accumulate’, giving ‘wooden building with multiple storeys’ (Katō takes more modestly as ‘two-storey wooden structure’). Note: NJK 婁 is taken in one view as 女 37 ‘woman’, with as phonetic with associated sense ‘shamaness, consult with shamaness’ (apparently a hunchback shamaness). Mizukami also notes a different view of 婁 as meaning ‘capture and link women together’. Schuessler gives original sense of 婁 as ‘mound’, and also notes possible link with ‘hunchbacked’.
